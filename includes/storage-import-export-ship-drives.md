FedEx, UPS, or DHL can be used to ship the package to Azure datacenter. If you want to use a carrier other than FedEx/DHL, contact Azure Data Box Operations team at `adbops@microsoft.com`

* Provide a valid FedEx, UPS, or DHL carrier account number that Microsoft will use to ship the drives back.
  * A FedEx, UPS, or DHL account number is required for shipping drives back from the US and Europe locations.
    * A DHL account number is preferred for shipping drives back from Asia and Australia locations.
    * If you do not have an account number, create a [FedEx](https://www.fedex.com/us/oadr/) or [DHL](http://www.dhl.com/) carrier account.
* When shipping your packages, you must follow the [Microsoft Azure Service Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/services-terms/).
* Securely package your disks to avoid potential damage and delays in processing. Here is how you can do that. 
    * Wrap the Disk Drives: Wrap each disk drive securely with bubble wrap. Make sure that the entire drive is covered and cushioned. The bubble wrap acts as a shock absorber and protects the drive from any impact during transit.
    * Place in Foam Shipper: Place the wrapped disk drive into a foam shipper. The foam shipper provides additional protection and keeps the drive-in place during transit.
