# Call and response: your first Bing Web Search query in Python

The Bing Web Search API provides a experience similar to Bing.com/Search by returning search results that Bing determines are relevant to the user's query. The results may include Web pages, images, videos, news, and entities, along with related search queries, spelling corrections, time zones, unit conversion, translations, and calculations. The kinds of results you get are based on their relevance and the tier of the Bing Search APIs to which you subscribe.

Refer to the [API reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-web-api-v7-reference) for technical details about the APIs.

You can run this example as a Jupyter notebook on [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org) by clicking on the launch Binder badge: 

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/cognitive-services-notebooks/master?filepath=BingWebSearchAPI.ipynb)


## Prerequisites
You must have a [Cognitive Services API account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) with **Bing Search APIs**. The [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=bing-web-search-api) is sufficient for this quickstart. You need the access key provided when you activate your free trial, or you may use a paid subscription key from your Azure dashboard.

## Running the walkthrough

Please set `subscriptionKey` below to your API key for the Bing API service.


```python
subscription_key = "96d05359d76f4e758906539daeab939e"
assert subscription_key
```

Next, please verify that the `search_url` endpoint is correct. At this writing, only one endpoint is used for Bing search APIs.  In the future, regional endpoints may be available.  If you encounter unexpected authorization errors, double-check this value against the endpoint for your Bing search instance in your Azure dashboard.


```python
search_url = "https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/search"
```

We will now search Bing for Microsoft Cognitive Services.


```python
search_term = "Microsoft Cognitive Services"
```

The following block uses the `requests` library in Python to call out to the Bing seach APIs and return the results as a JSON object. Observe that we pass in the API key via the `headers` dictionary and the search term via the `params` dictionary. To see the full list of options that can be used to filter search results, please see the [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-web-api-v7-reference) documentation.


```python
import requests

headers = {"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key" : subscription_key}
params  = {"q": search_term, "textDecorations":True, "textFormat":"HTML"}
response = requests.get(search_url, headers=headers, params=params)
response.raise_for_status()
search_results = response.json()
```

The `search_results` object contains the research results along with rich metadata such as related queries and pages. We can format the top pages returned by the query using the following lines of code


```python
from IPython.display import HTML

rows = "\n".join(["""<tr>
                       <td><a href=\"{0}\">{1}</a></td>
                       <td>{2}</td>
                     </tr>""".format(v["url"],v["name"],v["snippet"]) \
                  for v in search_results["webPages"]["value"]])
HTML("<table>{0}</table>".format(rows))
```
