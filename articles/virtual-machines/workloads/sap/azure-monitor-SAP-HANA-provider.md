3. IP address - Provide the IP address or hostname of the server running the SAP HANA instance to be monitored; when using a hostname, please ensure connectivity from within the Vnet.
4. Database tenant - Provide the HANA database to connect against (we strongly recommend using SYSTEMDB, since tenant databases don&#39;t have all monitoring views). Leave this field blank for legacy single-container HANA 1.0 instances.
5. Instance number - Provide the Instance number of the database [00-99], SQL port is automatically determined based on the instance number."
6. Database username - Provide the dedicated SAP HANA database user with the MONITORING role or BACKUP CATALOG READ role assigned (alternatively, use SYSTEM for non-production SAP HANA instances).
7. Database password - Provide the password corresponding to the database username, where you have two options on how to provide it:     
      a. Provide the password in the plain text.   
      b. Provide the password by selecting an existing or creating a new secret inside an Azure KeyVault.

   1. For **Type**, select **SAP HANA**. 

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > Ensure that a SAP HANA provider is configured for the SAP HANA `master` node.

   1. For **IP address**, enter the private IP address for the HANA server.

   1. For **Database tenant**, enter the name of the tenant you want to use. You can choose any tenant, but we recommend using **SYSTEMDB** because it enables a wider array of monitoring areas. 

   1. For **SQL port**, enter the port number associated with your HANA database. It should be in the format of *[3]* + *[instance#]* + *[13]*. An example is **30013**. 

   1. For **Database username**, enter the username you want to use. Ensure the database user has the *monitoring* and *catalog read* roles assigned.
