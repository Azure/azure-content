### Export and import automation rules (Preview)

Manage your Microsoft Sentinel automation rules as code! You can now export your automation rules to Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template files, and import rules from these files, as part of your program to manage and control your Microsoft Sentinel deployments as code. The export action will create a JSON file in your browser's downloads location, that you can then rename, move, and otherwise handle like any other file.

The exported JSON file is workspace-independent, so it can be imported to other workspaces and even other tenants. As code, it can also be version-controlled, updated, and deployed in a managed CI/CD framework.

The file includes all the parameters defined in the automation rule. Rules of any trigger type can be exported to a JSON file.

Learn more about [exporting and importing automation rules](import-export-automation-rules.md).

### Microsoft Sentinel support in Microsoft Defender multitenant management (Preview)

If you've onboarded Microsoft Sentinel to the Microsoft unified security operations platform, Microsoft Sentinel data is now available with Defender XDR data in Microsoft Defender multitenant management. Only one Microsoft Sentinel workspace per tenant is currently supported in the Microsoft unified security operations platform. So, Microsoft Defender multitenant management shows security information and event management (SIEM) data from one Microsoft Sentinel workspace per tenant. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender multitenant management](/defender-xdr/mto-overview) and [Microsoft Sentinel in the Microsoft Defender portal](microsoft-sentinel-defender-portal.md).

### Premium Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence data connector (Preview)

Your premium license for Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (MDTI) now unlocks the ability to ingest all premium indicators directly into your workspace. The premium MDTI data connector adds more to your hunting and research capabilities within Microsoft Sentinel. 

For more information, see [Understand threat intelligence](understand-threat-intelligence.md#add-threat-indicators-to-microsoft-sentinel-with-the-defender-threat-intelligence-data-connector). 

### Unified AMA-based connectors for syslog ingestion

With the impending retirement of the Log Analytics Agent, Microsoft Sentinel has consolidated the collection and ingestion of syslog, CEF, and custom-format log messages into three multi-purpose data connectors based on the Azure Monitor Agent (AMA):
- **Syslog via AMA**, for any device whose logs are ingested into the *Syslog* table in Log Analytics.
- **Common Event Format (CEF) via AMA**, for any device whose logs are ingested into the *CommonSecurityLog* table in Log Analytics.
- **New! Custom Logs via AMA (Preview)**, for any of 15 device types, or any unlisted device, whose logs are ingested into custom tables with names ending in *_CL* in Log Analytics.

These connectors replace nearly all the existing connectors for individual device and appliance types that have existed until now, that were based on either the legacy Log Analytics agent (also known as MMA or OMS) or the current Azure Monitor Agent. The solutions provided in the content hub for all of these devices and appliances now include whichever of these three connectors are appropriate to the solution.* The replaced connectors are now marked as "Deprecated" in the data connector gallery.

The data ingestion graphs that were previously found in each device's connector page can now be found in device-specific workbooks packaged with each device's solution.

\* When installing the solution for any of these applications, devices, or appliances, to ensure that the accompanying data connector is installed, you must select **Install with dependencies** on the solution page, and then mark the data connector on the following page.

For the updated procedures for installing these solutions, see the following articles:
- [CEF via AMA data connector - Configure specific appliance or device for Microsoft Sentinel data ingestion](unified-connector-cef-device.md)
- [Syslog via AMA data connector - Configure specific appliance or device for Microsoft Sentinel data ingestion](unified-connector-syslog-device.md)
- [Custom Logs via AMA data connector - Configure data ingestion to Microsoft Sentinel from specific applications](unified-connector-custom-device.md)

### Better visibility for Windows security events

We've enhanced the schema of the *SecurityEvent* table that hosts Windows Security events, and have added new columns to ensure compatibility with the Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) for Windows (version 1.28.2). These enhancements are designed to increase the visibility and transparency of collected Windows events. If you're not interested in receiving data in these fields, you can apply an ingestion-time transformation ("project-away" for example) to drop them.

### New Auxiliary logs retention plan (Preview)

The new **Auxiliary logs** retention plan for Log Analytics tables allows you to ingest large quantities of high-volume logs with supplemental value for security at a much lower cost. Auxiliary logs are available with interactive retention for 30 days, in which you can run simple, single-table queries on them, such as to summarize and aggregate the data. Following that 30-day period, auxiliary log data goes to long-term retention, which you can define for up to 12 years, at ultra-low cost. This plan also allows you to run search jobs on the data in long-term retention, extracting only the records you want to a new table that you can treat like a regular Log Analytics table, with full query capabilities.

To learn more about Auxiliary logs and compare with Analytics logs, see [Log retention plans in Microsoft Sentinel](log-plans.md).

For more in-depth information about the different log management plans, see [**Table plans**](../azure-monitor/logs/data-platform-logs.md#table-plans) in the [Azure Monitor Logs overview](../azure-monitor/logs/data-platform-logs.md) article from the Azure Monitor documentation.

### Create summary rules in Microsoft Sentinel for large sets of data (Preview)

Microsoft Sentinel now provides the ability to create dynamic summaries using [Azure Monitor summary rules](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/summary-rules), which aggregate large sets of data in the background for a smoother security operations experience across all log tiers.

- Access summary rule results via Kusto Query Language (KQL) across detection, investigation, hunting, and reporting activities.
- Run high performance Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries on summarized data.
- Use summary rule results for longer in investigations, hunting, and compliance activities.

For more information, see [Aggregate Microsoft Sentinel data with summary rules](summary-rules.md).
