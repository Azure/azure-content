# All about dual-protocol volumes in Azure NetApp Files

Some organizations have pure Windows or pure UNIX environments (homogenous) in which all data is accessed using only one of the following:

*	SMB and [NTFS](ntfs-overview.md) file security
*	NFS and UNIX file security - mode bits or [NFSv4.x access control lists (ACLs)](https://wiki.linux-nfs.org/wiki/index.php/ACLs)

However, many sites must enable data sets to be accessed from both Windows and UNIX clients (heterogenous). 
For environments with these requirements, Azure NetApp Files has native dual-protocol NAS support. After the user is authenticated on the network and has both appropriate share or export permissions and the necessary file-level permissions, data can be accessed by the user from UNIX hosts using NFS or from Windows hosts using SMB.
