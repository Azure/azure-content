# How AVS Addresses Vulnerabilities in the Infrastructure

At a high level, Azure VMware Solution (AVS) is a Microsoft Azure service and therefore must follow all the same policies and requirements that Azure follows. This means that AVS must follow the [SDL](https://www.microsoft.com/securityengineering/sdl) and must meet several regulatory requirements as promised by Microsoft Azure. 

## Our Approach to Vulnerabilities

AVS takes a defense in depth approach to vulnerability and risk management. We follow the [SDL](https://www.microsoft.com/securityengineering/sdl) and we start by building security controls into the products we build at design time, ensure that 3rd party solutions we are delivering as part of the service are hardened and secured by default , and we continually assess our services through both automation and manual reviews on an ongoing basis. We also partner with 3rd party vendors for early notifications of vulnerabilities within their solutions.

### Vulnerability Management

1. Signal of a vulnerability, CVE, 0 Day or other security issue is triaged by engineering and security teams.
1. Details within the signal are adjudicated and assigned a CVSS score and risk rating according to compensating controls within the service.
1. The risk rating is used against internal bug bars, internal policies and regulations to establish a timeline for implementing a fix.
1. Internal engineering teams partner with appropriate parties to qualify and roll out any fixes, patches and other configuration updates necessary.
1. Communications are drafted and published according to the risk rating assigned. 

### Subset of Regulations Governing Vulnerability and Risk Management

AVS is in scope for the following certifications and regulatory requirements below. The regulations listed below are not intended to be a complete list of certifications that AVS holds, rather it is a list that have specific requirements around vulnerability management and do not rely on other regulations for the same purpose. IE, certain regional certifications may point to ISO requirements for vulnerability management.
