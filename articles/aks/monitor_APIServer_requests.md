## Overview

This article describes how to use Azure diagnostics to enable logging for kube-audit and monitor the requests to apiserver from various sources.

## Scenario
* Monitor the requests that are coming to the API Server.
* To find which apiserver pod is serving the request.
* Which user agent is sending the request.
* What is the http method for the calls.
* Number of calls from each source.

Since AKS control plane is managed by Microsoft, the Kubernetes Audit logging is not enabled by default.

## Enable Kubernetes Audit Logging:

### To enable kubernetes audit logs 

Go to Diagnostic settings under Monitoring
Click on + Add diagnostic setting

### Diagnostic setting
* Give a name to the Diagnostic setting
* Select Kubernetes Audit under Categories
* Choose Send to Log Analytics workspace under Destination details
* Select the subscription for the Log Analytics workspace
* Choose the Log Analytics workspace to send the logs
* Save the settings

Once the kube-audit is enabled the data can be queried from the AzureDiagnostics table:


### Query the apiserver requests

```kusto
let starttime = datetime("2023-02-23T01:16:12.374Z");
let endtime = datetime("2023-02-24T12:16:12.374Z");
AzureDiagnostics
| where TimeGenerated between(starttime..endtime)
| where Category == "kube-audit"
| extend event = parse_json(log_s)
| extend HttpMethod = tostring(event.verb)
| extend User = tostring(parse_json(log_s).user.username)
| extend Apiserver = pod_s
| extend SourceIP = tostring(event.sourceIPs[0])
| project TimeGenerated, Category, HttpMethod, User, Apiserver, SourceIP, OperationName, event
```
