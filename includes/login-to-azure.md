## Log in to Azure

You'll use the Azure CLI 2.0 to create the resources needed to host your app in Azure. Log in to your Azure subscription with the [az login](/cli/azure/#login) command and follow the on-screen directions.  If you are using the Azure Cloud Shell, you will automatically be logged in.

```azurecli-interactive
az login
```
