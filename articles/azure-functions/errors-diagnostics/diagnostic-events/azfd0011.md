# AZFD0011: The FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME setting is required

This event occurs when a function app does not have `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME` set as an application setting.

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Event ID** |AZFD0011|
| **Severity** |Warning|

## Event description

The `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME` application setting is used to specify the language or language stack of the worker runtime to load in the function app. This corresponds to the language being used in your application (for example, `python`). For more information on valid values, see the [`FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME`](../../functions-app-settings#functions_worker_runtime) reference.

In most cases, the Functions host can determine the proper language without this setting, but there are also cases where it cannot. This can result in exceptions or unexected behavior. For this reason, `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME` will be a required setting in a future version of the host. It is recommended that all existing applications and deployment scripts include this to prevent any downtime.

## How to resolve the event

In a production application, add `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME` to the [application settings](../../functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings).

When running locally in Azure Functions Core Tools, add `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME` to the [local.settings.json file](../../functions-develop-local#local-settings-file).

## When to suppress the event

This event shouldn't be suppressed.
