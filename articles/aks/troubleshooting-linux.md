# Linux Performance Troubleshooting

Resource exhaustion on Linux machines is a common issue and can manifest through a wide variety of symptoms. This document provides a high-level overview of the tools available to help diagnose such issues.

Many of these tools accept an interval on which to produce rolling output. This output format typically makes spotting patterns much easier. Where accepted, the example invocation will include `[interval]`

This document draws heavily on Brenan Gregg's "Linux Performance Analysis in 60s".

## General

### uptime

```
$ uptime
 19:32:33 up 17 days, 12:36,  0 users,  load average: 0.21, 0.77, 0.69
```

uptime provides system uptime and 1, 5, and 15 minute load averages. These load averages roughly correspond to threads doing work or waiting for uninterruptible work to complete. In absolute these numbers can be difficult to interpret, but measured over time they can tell us useful information:

- 1 min average > 5 minute average means load is increasing.
- 1 min average < 5 minute average means load is decreasing.

uptime can also illuminate why information is not available: a recent restart may have resolved the issue, or it may have mitigated before the user was able to run the command on the machine. Low uptime or decreasing load averages would highlight this.

load averages higher than the number of CPU threads available may indicate a performance issue with a given workload.

### dmesg

```
$ dmesg | tail 
$ dmesg --level=err | tail
```

dmesg dumps the kernel buffer, which may be useful for debugging situations such as OOMKill, which will be visible in the mesg logs. The kernel ring buffer data is one component of what eventually ends up in Linux syslogs.

### top

```
$ top
Tasks: 249 total,   1 running, 158 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
%Cpu(s):  2.2 us,  1.3 sy,  0.0 ni, 95.4 id,  1.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.2 si,  0.0 st
KiB Mem : 65949064 total, 43415136 free,  2349328 used, 20184600 buff/cache
KiB Swap:        0 total,        0 free,        0 used. 62739060 avail Mem

   PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND
116004 root      20   0  144400  41124  27028 S  11.8  0.1 248:45.45 coredns
  4503 root      20   0 1677980 167964  89464 S   5.9  0.3   1326:25 kubelet
     1 root      20   0  120212   6404   4044 S   0.0  0.0  48:20.38 systemd
     ...
```

top provides a broad overview of current system state. The headers provide some useful aggregate information:

- state of tasks: running, sleeping, stopped.
- CPU utilization, in this case mostly showing idle time.
- total, free, and used system memory.

top may miss short-lived processes; alternatives like htop and atop provide similar interfaces while fixing some of these shortcomings.

## CPU

### mpstat

```
$ mpstat -P ALL [interval]
Linux 4.15.0-1064-azure (aks-main-10212767-vmss000001)  02/10/20        _x86_64_        (8 CPU)

```

mpstat prints similar CPU information to top, but broken down by CPU thread. This can be useful for detecting highly imbalanced CPU usage, for example when a single threaded application uses one core at 100% utilization. This may be more difficult to spot when aggregated over all CPUs in the system.

### vmstat

```
$ vmstat [interval]
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----
 r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st
 2  0      0 43300372 545716 19691456    0    0     3    50    3    3  2  1 95  1  0
```

vmstat provides similar information mpstat and top, enumerating number of processes waiting on CPU (r column), memory statistics, and percent of CPU time spent in each work state.

## Memory

### free

```
$ free -m
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:          64403        2338       42485           1       19579       61223
Swap:             0           0           0
```

free presents basic information about total memory as well as used and free memory. vmstat may be more useful even for basic memory analysis due to its ability to provide rolling output.

## Disk

### iostat

```
$ iostat -xy [interval] [count]
$ iostat -xy 1 1
Linux 4.15.0-1064-azure (aks-main-10212767-vmss000001)  02/10/20        _x86_64_        (8 CPU)

```

iostat provides extremely powerful insights into disk utilization. This invocation passes `-x` for extended statistics, `-y` to skip the initial output printing system averages since boot, and `1 1` to specify we want 1 seconds interval, ending after one block of output. 

iostat exposes many useful statistics:

- r/s and w/s are reads per second and writes per second. The sum of these values is IOPS.
- rkB/s and wkB/s are kilobytes read/written per second. The sum of these values is throughput.
- await is the average iowait time in milliseconds for queued requests.
- avgqu-sz is the average queue size over the provided interval.

On an Azure VM:

- the sum of r/s and w/s for an individual block device may not exceed that disk's SKU limits.
- the sum of rkB/s and wkB/s  for an individual block device may not exceed that disk's SKU limits
- the sum of r/s and w/s for all block devices may not exceed the limits for the VM SKU.
- the sum of  rkB/s and wkB/s for all block devices may not exceed the limits for the VM SKU.

Non-zero values of await or avgqu-sz are also good indicators of IO contention.

sar is an extremely powerful tool for a wide range of analysis. While this example uses its ability to measure network stats, it is equally powerful for measuring CPU and memory consumption. This example invokes sar with `-n` flag to specify the `DEV` (network device) keyword, displaying network throughput by device.

- The sum of rxKb/s and txKb/s is total throughput for a given device. When this value exceeds the limit for the provisioned Azure NIC, workloads on the machine will experience increased network latency.
- %ifutil measures utilization for a given device. As this value approaches 100%, workloads will experience increased network latency.

```
$ sar -n TCP,ETCP [interval]
Linux 4.15.0-1064-azure (aks-main-10212767-vmss000001)  02/10/20        _x86_64_        (8 CPU)

Average:         0.00      0.00      0.00      0.00      0.00
```

This invocation of sar uses the `TCP,ETCP` keywords to examine TCP connections. The third column of the last row, "retrans", is the number of TCP retransmits per second. High values for this field indicate an unreliable network connection. In The first and third rows, "active" means a connection originated from the local device, while "remote" indicates an incoming connection.  On Azure, this may be useful when troubleshooting issues like SNAT port exhaustion due to high TCP connection rate; this would appear as high "active" value in the sar output. 

As sar takes an interval, it prints rolling output and then prints final rows of output containing the average results from the invocation.
