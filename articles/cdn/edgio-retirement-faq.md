# Azure CDN from Edgio retirement FAQ

Azure CDN from Edgio will be shut down on January 15, 2025. You must migrate your workload to Azure Front Door before January 7, 2025 to avoid service disruption. This article provides answers to common questions about the retirement of Azure CDN from Edgio.

## Frequently asked questions

### Why was the retirement date of Azure CDN from Edgio changed from November 4, 2025, to January 15, 2025?

[Akamai acquired select assets](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/akamai-completes-acquisition-of-select-assets-of-edgio-302331398.html) from Edgio in December of 2024, and Microsoft was informed that the Edgio platform will end service on January 15, 2025. All Azure CDN from Edgio users must migrate their workloads to Azure Front Door or other CDN services before this date.

### I see Edgio filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Can Microsoft guarantee that Azure CDN from Edgio’s availability and services until November 4, 2025?

Edgio has informed us that their services will remain operational until at least January 15, 2025. However, we can't guarantee that Edgio won't unexpectedly cease operations before this date due to circumstances beyond our control. Therefore, we'll automatically migrate your workload if you haven't taken action by January 7, 2025.

### How can I see my impacted Azure CDN from Edgio resources?

You can see them in the [Migrate away from Azure CDN from Edgio](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Expert/RecommendationList.ReactView/recommendationTypeId/2c9e3f2a-7373-45e1-ab8b-f361e5f0c37f) dashboard.

### What options do I have with migrating my workloads out of Azure CDN from Edgio?

The following is a recap of the migration options we sent to all users:

- Validate if your workloads on Azure CDN from Edgio are compatible with Azure Front Door and migrate as soon as possible using these instructions before January 7, 2025. For more information, see [Comparison between Azure Front Door and Azure CDN services](../frontdoor/front-door-cdn-comparison.md) and [Frequently asked questions for Azure Front Door](../frontdoor/front-door-faq.yml).
    - If you already use custom domains, follow steps in [Migrate Azure CDN from Edgio to Azure Front Door](../frontdoor/migrate-cdn-to-front-door.md).
    - If you want to migrate while retaining your existing *.azureedge.net domain, follow steps in [Migrate to Azure Front Door while retaining *.azureedge.net domain](migrate-cdn-to-front-door-retain-edge-domain.md).

- If Azure Front Door isn't compatible with your workloads, determine if Akamai could be compatible via Azure Marketplace or work with another CDN provider. If you chose to work with Akamai, feel free to contact Microsoft Support, and we can put you in touch with the Akamai team dedicated to performing migrations to their platform.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > - If you plan a migration to Akamai or another CDN provider, you must set the Feature Flag `DoNotForceMigrateEdgioCDNProfiles` before January 7, 2025. Doing so will prevent Microsoft from migrating you to Azure Front Door (please see below). Note you will have until January 14, 2025 to complete your migration to another CDN, but again Microsoft cannot guarantee your services will be available on the Edgio platform before this date.
    > - Please be advised we will need to halt all configuration changes to Azure CDN by Edgio profiles starting on January 3, 2025. This means you will not be able update your CDN profile configuration, but your services on Azure CDN from Edgio will still operate until you are migrated or the Edgio platform is shut down on January 15, 2025

- If you have any services running on Azure CDN from Edgio on January 7, 2025 and haven't informed us of your plans (please see above), we'll attempt to migrate your services over to Azure Front Door on January 7, 2025. We'll be performing this migration to Azure Front Door on a “best effort” basis, and doing so might cause issues related to the billing, features, availability, and/or performance you're currently consuming with Azure CDN from Edgio.

### What are some key things I should do to verify my workloads are working properly on AFD?

- Look at [metrics and logs](../frontdoor/front-door-diagnostics.md) for Azure Front Door resources to observe for 4xx/5xx errors, cache/byte hit ratios, and origin health.
- See the following troubleshooting guides for any other issues:
    - [Troubleshoot Azure Front Door common issues](../frontdoor/troubleshoot-issues.md)
    - [Troubleshoot general performance problems](../frontdoor/troubleshoot-performance-issues.md)
    - [Frequently asked questions](../frontdoor/front-door-faq.yml)

### How does Azure Front Door billing work?

Depending on your workloads, Azure Front Door can be more cost-effective than Azure CDN from Edgio. Note that the Azure Front Door billing model differs from Azure CDN from Edgio and includes different billing components. Specifically, Azure Front Door charges a base fee for each profile deployed. Additionally, charges are incurred for requests and data transfer based on usage. See the following for details:

For any questions regarding billing changes, reach out to our support team or your account team.

### Does Microsoft validate my workloads work on Azure Front Door?

No, you need to determine if Azure Front Door suits your workloads. We recommend setting up a test environment to validate that your services are compatible with Azure Front Door.

### What will happen after Microsoft migrates my workloads to Azure Front Door on January 7, 2025?

After the migration, you'll receive an email notification confirming whether your workloads have been successfully migrated to Azure Front Door Standard or if the migration was unsuccessful. We're migrating you to Azure Front Door Standard as it may be more cost-effective. If you need the extra features of Azure Front Door Premium, you can [upgrade your service](../frontdoor/tier-upgrade.md).

If the migration was unsuccessful or if you encounter issues with availability, performance, or feature functionality after a successful migration, contact Microsoft support for assistance.

### How is Microsoft communicating the retirement of Azure CDN from Edgio, and how often are reminders sent?

We communicate the retirement of Azure CDN from Edgio through multiple channels, including email notifications and in-portal messages. Reminders are sent at least monthly to all users with active Edgio profiles to ensure they're aware of the upcoming changes and necessary actions.

### Can I request an extension for the retirement/shutdown of the Azure CDN from Edgio service?

No, extensions aren't possible. Edgio confirmed that their platform will shut down by January 15, 2025.

### Can I retain my existing *.azureedge.net domain when I move to Azure Front Door?

You can temporarily retain your *.azureedge.net domain by following the instructions provided in [Migrate to Azure Front Door while retaining *.azureedge.net domain](migrate-cdn-to-front-door-retain-edge-domain.md). However, this is only a short-term solution due to the urgent retirement of Azure CDN from Edgio. Relying on domains like *.azureedge.net and *.azurefd.net isn't recommended as it poses availability risks. To ensure greater flexibility and avoid a single point of failure, it's advisable to adopt a custom domain as soon as possible.
