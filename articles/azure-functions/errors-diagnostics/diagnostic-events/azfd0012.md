# AZFD0012: A non highly-identifiable secret has been loaded by the application

This event occurs when a Function App has either the `StrictHISModeWarn` or `StrictHISModeEnabled` feature flag enabled via application setting `AzureWebJobsFeatureFlags`.

| | Value |

| **Event ID** |AZFD0012|
| **Severity** |Warning or Error|

## Event description

The runtime has identified that one or more non highly-identifiable secrets (HIS) have been loaded by the host. A HIS value includes a signature/checksum that enables automated scanning tools to identify the secret value as an Azure Functions key value. This aids in the remediation of inadvertently leaked secrets, for example if they were accidentally checked into GitHub, etc.

By default, the key values generated by Azure Functions are HIS. However, applications that were created long ago may still have legacy non-HIS key values that were generated before the key generation logic was updated.

## How to resolve the event

The event will indicate the name and type of the key that is in violation. This key value should be be regenerated.

## When to suppress the event

This event shouldn't be suppressed.
