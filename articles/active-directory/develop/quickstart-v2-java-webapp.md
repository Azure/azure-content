# Quickstart: Add sign-in with Microsoft to a Java web app

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-develop-applies-v2](../../../includes/active-directory-develop-applies-v2.md)]

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to integrate a Java web application with the Microsoft Identity platform. Your app 
will sign in a user, get an access token to call the Microsoft Graph API, and make a request to the Microsoft Graph API. 

When you've completed the guide, your application will accept sign-ins of personal Microsoft accounts (including outlook.com,
 live.com, and others) and work or school accounts from any company or organization that uses Azure Active Directory.

> [!div renderon="docs"]
> ## Register and download your quickstart app
> You have two options to start your quickstart application:
> * [Express] [Option 1: Register and auto configure your app and then download your code sample](#option-1-register-and-auto-configure-your-app-and-then-download-your-code-sample)
> * [Manual] [Option 2: Register and manually configure your application and code sample](#option-2-register-and-manually-configure-your-application-and-code-sample)
>
> ### Option 1: Register and auto configure your app and then download your code sample
>
> 1. Go to the [Azure portal - App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps).
> 1. Enter a name for your application and select **Register**.
> 1. Follow the instructions to download and automatically configure your new application for you in one click.
>
> ### Option 2: Register and manually configure your application and code sample
>
> #### Step 1: Register your application
> To register your application and manually add the app's registration information to your solution, follow these steps:
>
> 1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
> 1. If your account gives you access to more than one tenant, select your account in the top right corner, and set your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.
> 1. Navigate to the Microsoft identity platform for developers [App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) page.
> 1. Select **New registration**.
> 1. When the **Register an application** page appears, enter your application's registration information:
>    - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `java-webapp`.
>    - Leave **Redirect URI** blank for now, and select **Register**.
> 1. Select the **Authentication** menu, and then add the following information:
>    - In **Redirect URIs**, add `http://localhost:8080/msal4jsamples/secure/aad` and `https://localhost:8080/msal4jsamples/graph/users`,  and select **Save**.
>    - Select **Save**.
> 1. On the left hand menu, choose **Certificates & secrets** and click on **New client secret** in the Client Secrets section:
>     
>    - Type a key description (of instance app secret),
>    - Select a key duration of either In 1 year, In 2 years, or Never Expires.
>    - When you click on **Add**, the key value will be displayed. Copy and save the value in a safe location.
>    - You'll need this key later to configure the project. This key value will not be displayed again, nor retrievable by any other means, so record it as soon as it is visible from the Azure portal.
>
> [!div class="sxs-lookup" renderon="portal"]
> #### Step 1: Configure your application in the Azure portal
> For the code sample for this quickstart to work, you need to:
> 1. Add reply URLs as `http://localhost:8080/msal4jsamples/secure/aad` and `https://localhost:8080/msal4jsamples/graph/users`
> 1. Create a Client Secret
> > [!div renderon="portal" id="makechanges" class="nextstepaction"]
> > [Make this change for me]()
>
> > [!div id="appconfigured" class="alert alert-info"]
> > ![Already configured](media/quickstart-v2-aspnet-webapp/green-check.png) Your application is configured with these attributes.

#### Step 2: Download the code sample

- [Download the Code Sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-java-webapp/archive/master.zip)

#### Step 3: Configure the code sample 

1. Extract the zip file to a local folder within the root folder - for example, **C:\Azure-Samples**
1. If you use an integrated development environment, open up the sample in your favorite IDE (optional).
1. Edit the **application.properties** file. 
    1. Find `aad.clientId` and update the value of `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with the **Application (client) ID** value of the application you registered. 
    1. Find `aad.authority` and update the value of `YOUR_TENANT_NAME` with the **Directory (tenant) ID** value of the application you registered.
    1. Find `aad.secretKey` and update the value of `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` with the **Client Secret** you created in **Certificates & Secrets** for the application you registered.



> [!div renderon="docs"]
> Where:
> - `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` - is the **Application (client) ID** for the application you registered in the Azure portal. You can find **Application (client) ID** in the app's **Overview** page.
> - `YOUR_TENANT_NAME` - is one of the following options:
>   - If your application supports **Accounts in this organizational directory only**, replace this value with the **Tenant ID** or **Tenant name** (for example, contoso.microsoft.com)
>   - If your application supports **Accounts in any organizational directory**, replace this value with `organizations`
>   - If your application supports **All Microsoft account users**, replace this value with `common`
> - `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` with the **Client Secret** you created in **Certificates & Secrets** for the application you registered.
>
> > [!TIP]
> > To find the values of **Application (client) ID**, **Directory (tenant) ID**, and **Supported account types**, go to the app's **Overview** page in the Azure portal.
> > To find the value of **Client Secret**, go to *Certificates & Secrets*. If you didn't write this value down when created, you'll have to create another client secret, as they are not retrievable after creation

## More information

### Getting MSAL
MSAL4J is the library used to sign in users and request tokens used to access an API protected by the Microsoft Identity Platform. 
You can add MSAL4J to your application by using Maven or Gradle to manage your dependencies: 

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.microsoft.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>msal4j</artifactId>
    <version>0.5.0-preview</version>
</dependency>
```

```$xslt

```


###Msal initialization
You can add the reference for MSAL by adding the following code: 

```
import com.microsoft.aad.msal4j.*;
```
