# Available extensions for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters

[Cluster extensions for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes](conceptual-extensions.md) provide an Azure Resource Manager-driven experience for installation and lifecycle management of different Azure capabilities on top of your cluster. These extensions can be [deployed to your clusters](extensions.md) to enable different scenarios and improve cluster management.

The following extensions are currently available for use with Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters. All of these extensions are [cluster-scoped](conceptual-extensions.md#extension-scope), except for Azure API Management on Azure Arc, which is namespace-scoped.

## Azure Monitor Container Insights

- **Supported distributions**: All Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) certified Kubernetes clusters

Azure Monitor Container Insights provides visibility into the performance of workloads deployed on the Kubernetes cluster. Use this extension to collect memory and CPU utilization metrics from controllers, nodes, and containers.

> The [Flux v2.3.0 release](https://fluxcd.io/blog/2024/05/flux-v2.3.0/) includes API changes to the HelmRelease and HelmChart APIs, with deprecated fields removed, and an updated version of the kustomize package. An upcoming minor version update of Microsoft's Flux extension will include these changes, consistent with the upstream OSS Flux project.
>
> The [HelmRelease](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/helm/helmreleases/) kind will be promoted from `v2beta1` to `v2` (GA). The `v2` API is backwards compatible with `v2beta1`, with the exception of these deprecated fields, which will be removed:
>
> - `.spec.chart.spec.valuesFile`: replaced by `.spec.chart.spec.valuesFiles`
> - `.spec.postRenderers.kustomize.patchesJson6902`: replaced by `.spec.postRenderers.kustomize.patches`
> - `.spec.postRenderers.kustomize.patchesStrategicMerge`: replaced by `.spec.postRenderers.kustomize.patches`
> - `.status.lastAppliedRevision`: replaced by `.status.history.chartVersion`
>
> The [HelmChart](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/helmcharts/) kind will be promoted from `v1beta2` to `v1` (GA). The `v1` API is backwards compatible with `v1beta2`, with the exception of the `.spec.valuesFile` field, which will be replaced by `.spec.valuesFiles`.
>
> Use the new fields which are already available in the current version of the APIs, instead of the fields that will be removed.
>
> The kustomize package will be updated to v5.4.0, which contains the following breaking changes:
>
> - [Kustomization build fails when resources key is missing](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/issues/5337)
> - [Components are now applied after generators and before transformers](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/pull/5170) in [v5.1.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/tag/kustomize%2Fv5.1.0)
> - [Null yaml values are replaced by "null"](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/pull/5519) in [v5.4.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/tag/kustomize%2Fv5.4.0)
>
> To avoid issues due to breaking changes, we recommend updating your manifests as soon as possible to ensure that your Flux configurations remain compliant with this release.


> [!NOTE]
> When a new version of the `microsoft.flux` extension is released, it may take several days for the new version to become available in all regions.
