# Get started with UI Library Design Kit (Figma)

This article describes how to get started with the UI Library Design Kit (Figma).

Start by getting the [UI Library Design Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1095841357293210472) from Figma.

## Design faster 

A resource to help design user interfaces built on Azure Communication Services, the UI Library Design Kit includes components, composites, and UX guidance purpose-built to help bring your video calling and chat experiences to life faster.  

## UI Library components and composites 

The same components and composites offered in the UI Library are available in Figma so you can quickly begin designing and prototyping your calling and chat experiences.  

## Built on Fluent 

The UI Library Design Kit's components are based on Microsoft’s Fluent UI; so, they’re built with usability, accessibility, and localization in mind.
