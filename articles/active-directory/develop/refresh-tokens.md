# Microsoft identity platform refresh tokens

When a client acquires an access token to access a protected resource, the client also receives a refresh token. The refresh token is used to obtain new access/refresh token pairs when the current access token expires. Refresh tokens are also used to acquire extra access tokens for other resources. Refresh tokens are bound to a combination of user and client, but aren't tied to a resource or tenant. This allows a client to use a refresh token to acquire access tokens across any combination of resource and tenant where it has permission to do so. Refresh tokens are encrypted and only the Microsoft identity platform can read them.

## Prerequisites

Before reading through this article, it's recommended that you go through the following articles:

* [ID tokens](id-tokens.md) in the Microsoft identity platform.
* [Access tokens](access-tokens.md) in the Microsoft identity platform.

## Refresh token lifetime

Refresh tokens have a significantly longer lifetime than access tokens. The default lifetime for the tokens is 90 days and they replace themselves with a fresh token upon every use. This means that whenever a refresh token is used to acquire a new access token, a new refresh token is also issued. The Microsoft identity platform doesn't revoke old refresh tokens when used to fetch new access tokens. Securely delete the old refresh token after acquiring a new one. Refresh tokens need to be stored safely like access tokens or application credentials. 

## Refresh token expiration

Refresh tokens can be revoked at any time, because of timeouts and revocations. Your app must handle rejections by the sign-in service gracefully when this occurs. This is done by sending the user to an interactive sign-in prompt to sign in again. 

### Token timeouts

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of January 30, 2021 you can not configure refresh token lifetimes. Azure Active Directory no longer honors refresh token configuration in existing policies.  New tokens issued after existing tokens have expired are now set to the [default configuration](#configurable-token-lifetime-properties).
>
> Existing tokenâ€™s lifetime will not be changed. After they expire, a new token will be issued based on the default value.
>
> If you need to continue to define the time period before a user is asked to sign in again, configure sign-in frequency in Conditional Access. To learn more about Conditional Access, read [Configure authentication session management with Conditional Access](../conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-session-lifetime.md).
> You can learn more about refresh token lifetime policy properties by reading [Refresh and session token lifetime policy properties](/active-directory-configurable-token-lifetimes#refresh-and-session-token-lifetime-policy-properties)



### Revocation

Refresh tokens can be revoked by the server because of a change in credentials, user action, or admin action.  Refresh tokens fall into two classes: tokens issued to confidential clients (the rightmost column) and tokens issued to public clients (all other columns).

| Change | Password-based cookie | Password-based token | Non-password-based cookie | Non-password-based token | Confidential client token |
|---|-----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Password expires | Stays alive | Stays alive | Stays alive | Stays alive | Stays alive |
| Password changed by user | Revoked | Revoked | Stays alive | Stays alive | Stays alive |
| User does SSPR | Revoked | Revoked | Stays alive | Stays alive | Stays alive |
| Admin resets password | Revoked | Revoked | Stays alive | Stays alive | Stays alive |
| User revokes their refresh tokens [via PowerShell](/powershell/module/azuread/revoke-azureadsignedinuserallrefreshtoken) | Revoked | Revoked | Revoked | Revoked | Revoked |
| Admin revokes all refresh tokens for a user [via PowerShell](/powershell/module/azuread/revoke-azureaduserallrefreshtoken) | Revoked | Revoked |Revoked | Revoked | Revoked |
| Single sign-out [on web](v2-protocols-oidc.md#single-sign-out) | Revoked | Stays alive | Revoked | Stays alive | Stays alive |
