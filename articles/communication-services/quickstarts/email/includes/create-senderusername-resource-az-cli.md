## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet/).
- Install [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli) 
- An Azure Communication Services Email Resource created and ready to add the domains. See [Get started with Creating Email Communication Resource](../../../quickstarts/email/create-email-communication-resource.md).
- A custom domain with higher than default sending limits provisioned and ready. See [Quickstart: How to add custom verified email domains](../../../quickstarts/email/add-custom-verified-domains.md).

## Create Sender username resource

To create a Sender Username resource, [sign in to Azure CLI](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli). You can sign in running the ```az login``` command from the terminal and providing your credentials. Run the following command to create the resource:

```azurepowershell-interactive
az communication email domain sender-username create –-email-service-name "<EmailServiceName>" --resource-group "<resourceGroup>" --domain-name "test.net" –-sender-username "test" –-username "test"
```

If you would like to select a specific subscription, you can also specify the ```--subscription``` flag and provide the subscription ID.
```azurepowershell-interactive
az communication email domain sender-username create –-email-service-name "<EmailServiceName>" --resource-group "<resourceGroup>" --domain-name "test.net" –-sender-username "test" –-username "test" --subscription "<subscriptionId>"
```

You can configure your Domain resource with the following options:

* The [resource group](../../../../azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-cli.md)
* The name of the Email Communication Services resource.
* The geography the resource will be associated with.
* The name of the Domain resource.
* The name of the Sender Username.
* The name of the Username.

Note: The Sender Username and Username should be same.

## Manage your Sender Username resource

To add or update display name to your Sender Username resource, run the following commands. You can target a specific subscription as well.

```azurepowershell-interactive
az communication email domain sender-username update –-email-service-name "<EmailServiceName>" --resource-group "<resourceGroup>" --domain-name "test.net" –-sender-username "test" –-display-name "testdisplayname"

az communication email domain sender-username update –-email-service-name "<EmailServiceName>" --resource-group "<resourceGroup>" --domain-name "test.net" –-sender-username "test" –-display-name "testdisplayname" --subscription "<subscriptionId>"
```

To list all of your Sender Username resources in a given Domain use the following command:

```azurepowershell-interactive
az communication email domain sender-username list –-email-service-name "<EmailServiceName>" --resource-group "<resourceGroup>" --domain-name "test.net"
```

To show all the information on a given resource use the following command:

```azurepowershell-interactive
az communication email domain sender-username list –-email-service-name "<EmailServiceName>" --resource-group "<resourceGroup>" --domain-name "test.net" --sender-username "test"
```

#### Delete Sender Username resource

If you want to clean up and remove a Sender Username resource, you can delete your Sender Username resource by running the following command.

```azurepowershell-interactive
az communication email sender-username delete –-email-service-name "<EmailServiceName>" --resource-group "<resourceGroup>" --domain-name "test.net" --sender-username "test"
```
