# Bicep error code - BCP057

This error occurs when the referenced name doesn't exist, either because of a typo or because it hasn't been declared.

## Error description

`The name <name> does not exist in the current context.`

## Solution

Fix the typo or declare the name.

## Examples

The following example raises the error because _bar_ has never been declared:

```bicep
var foo = bar 
```

The following example raises the error because _bar1_ is a typo:

```bicep
var bar = 'white'
var foo = bar1 
```

You can fix the error by declaring _bar_, or fix the typo.

```bicep
var bar = 'white'
var foo = bar 
```
