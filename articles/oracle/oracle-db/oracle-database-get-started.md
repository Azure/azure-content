# Get started with Oracle Database@Azure

In this article, you learn about how to purchase and use Oracle Database@Azure.

Oracle Database@Azure is an Oracle database service running on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), colocated in Microsoft data centers. This ensures that the Oracle Database@Azure service has the fastest possible access to Azure resources and applications.

Oracle Database@Azure runs on infrastructure managed by Oracle's expert Cloud Infrastructure operations team. The operations team performs software patching, infrastructure updates, and other operations through a connection to OCI. While the service requires that customers have an OCI tenancy, most service activities take place in the Azure environment.

## Purchase Oracle Database@Azure
To purchase Oracle Database@Azure, contact Oracle's sales team or your Oracle sales representative for a sale offer. Oracle Sales will create an Azure Private Offer in the Azure Marketplace for your service. After an offer has been created for your organization, you can accept the offer and complete the purchase in the Azure portal's Marketplace service. For more information on Azure private offers, see Overview of the commercial marketplace and enterprise procurement.

Billing and payment for the service is done through Azure. Payment for Oracle Database@Azure counts toward your Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC). Existing Oracle Database software customers can use the Bring Your Own License (BYOL) option or Unlimited License Agreements (ULAs). On your regular Microsoft Azure invoices, you'll see charges for Oracle Database@Azure alongside charges for your other Azure Marketplace services.

## Oracle Database@Azure Interfaces
You can provision Oracle Database@Azure using the Azure portal and Azure APIs, SDKs and Terraform. Management of Oracle database system infrastructure and VM cluster resources takes place in the Azure portal as well.

For Oracle Container Databases (CDB) and Oracle Pluggable Databases (PDB), some management tasks are completed using the OCI console.

Database and application developers work in the Azure portal or use Azure tools (Azure API, SDK, Terraform) to interact with Oracle Database@Azure databases.
