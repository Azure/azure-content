# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Mitel MiCloud Connect or Cloudlink Platform

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Mitel Connect app to integrate Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) with Mitel MiCloud Connect or CloudLink Platform. The Mitel Connect app is available in the Azure Gallery. Integrating Azure AD with MiCloud Connect or CloudLink Platform provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control userâ€™s access to MiCloud Connect apps and to CloudLink apps in Azure AD by using their enterprise credentials.
* You can enable users on your account to be automatically signed-in to MiCloud Connect or CloudLink (single sign-on) using their Azure AD accounts.


For details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin the integration of Azure AD with Mitel MiCloud Connect or CloudLink Platform.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with MiCloud Connect, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription

  If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* A Mitel MiCloud Connect account or Mitel CloudLink Account, depending on the application you want to configure.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you'll configure and test Azure AD single sign-on (SSO).


## Adding Mitel Connect from the gallery

To configure the integration of Mitel Connect into Azure AD, you need to add Mitel Connect from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps in the Azure portal.
* Mitel Connect supports **SP** initiated SSO

**To add Mitel Connect from the gallery, do the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory**.

	![The Azure Active Directory button](common/select-azuread.png)

2. Click **Enterprise Applications** and then click **All Applications**.
