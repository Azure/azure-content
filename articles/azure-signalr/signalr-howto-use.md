## Provision an Azure SignalR Service instance

Follow [Quickstart: Use an ARM template to deploy Azure SignalR](./signalr-quickstart-azure-signalr-service-arm-template.md) to provision a SignalR service instance.

## For ASP&#46;NET Core SignalR

## Scale Out Application Server

With Azure SignalR Service, persistent connections are offloaded from application server so that you can focus on implementing your business logic in hub classes.
But you still need to scale out application servers for better performance when handling massive client connections.
Below are a few tips for scaling out application servers.
- Multiple application servers can connect to the same Azure SignalR Service instance.
- As long as the name of the hub class is the same, connections from different application servers are grouped in the same hub.
- Each client connection will only be created in ***one*** of the application servers, and messages from that client will only be sent to that same application server. If you want to access client information globally *(from all application servers)*, you have to use some centralized storage to save client information from all application servers.

In this guide, you learned about how to scale single SignalR Service instance.

Autoscale is supported in Azure SignalR Service Premium Tier.

Multiple endpoints are also supported for scaling, sharding, and cross-region scenarios.
