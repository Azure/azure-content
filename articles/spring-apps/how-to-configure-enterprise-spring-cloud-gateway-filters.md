# How to use VMware Spring Cloud Gateway route filters with the Azure Spring Apps Enterprise plan

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Spring Apps is the new name for the Azure Spring Cloud service. Although the service has a new name, you'll see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams.

**This article applies to:** ❌ Basic/Standard ✔️ Enterprise

This article shows you how to use VMware Spring Cloud Gateway route filters with the Azure Spring Apps Enterprise plan to route requests to your applications.

[VMware Spring Cloud Gateway](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Spring-Cloud-Gateway-for-Kubernetes/index.html) is a commercial VMware Tanzu component based on the open-source Spring Cloud Gateway project. Spring Cloud Gateway handles cross-cutting concerns for API development teams, such as single sign-on (SSO), access control, rate-limiting, resiliency, security, and more. You can accelerate API delivery using modern cloud native patterns, and any programming language you choose for API development.

Spring Cloud Gateway includes the following features:

- Dynamic routing configuration, independent of individual applications that can be applied and changed without recompilation.
- Commercial API route filters for transporting authorized JSON Web Token (JWT) claims to application services.
- Client certificate authorization.
- Rate-limiting approaches.
- Circuit breaker configuration.
- Support for accessing application services via HTTP Basic Authentication credentials.

To integrate with [API portal for VMware Tanzu®](./how-to-use-enterprise-api-portal.md), VMware Spring Cloud Gateway automatically generates OpenAPI version 3 documentation after any route configuration additions or changes.

## Prerequisites

- An already provisioned Azure Spring Apps Enterprise plan service instance with Spring Cloud Gateway enabled. For more information, see [Quickstart: Build and deploy apps to Azure Spring Apps using the Enterprise plan](quickstart-deploy-apps-enterprise.md).

  > [!NOTE]
  > To use Spring Cloud Gateway, you must enable it when you provision your Azure Spring Apps service instance. You cannot enable it after provisioning at this time.

- [Azure CLI version 2.0.67 or later](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Filters

Filters are used in your Spring Cloud Gateway configuration to act on the incoming request or outgoing response to a route configuration.

Example uses for a filter could be in adding an HTTP header, or denying access based on an authorization token.

## Use Open Source Filters

Spring Cloud Gateway OSS includes a number of `GatewayFilter` factories used to create filters for routes.

### AddRequestHeader

The AddRequestHeader GatewayFilter factory takes a name and value parameter. The following example configures an AddRequestHeader GatewayFilter:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/api/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "AddRequestHeader=X-Request-red, blue"
        ]
    }
]
```

This listing adds `X-Request-red:blue` header to the downstream request’s headers for all matching requests.

AddRequestHeader is aware of the URI variables used to match a path or host. URI variables may be used in the value and are expanded at runtime. The following example configures an AddRequestHeader GatewayFilter that uses a variable:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/api/{segment}"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "AddRequestHeader=X-Request-red, blue-{segment}"
        ]
    }
]
```

### AddRequestHeadersIfNotPresent

Adds headers if not present in the original request.

Configuration parameters:

- `headers`: comma-separated list of key-value pairs (header name, header value)

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/api/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "AddRequestHeadersIfNotPresent=Content-Type:application/json,Connection:keep-alive"
        ]
    }
]
```

### AddRequestParameter

The AddRequestParameter GatewayFilter Factory takes a name and value parameter. The following example configures an AddRequestParameter GatewayFilter:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/api/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "AddRequestParameter=red, blue"
        ]
    }
]
```

This will add red=blue to the downstream request’s query string for all matching requests.

AddRequestParameter is aware of the URI variables used to match a path or host. URI variables may be used in the value and are expanded at runtime. The following example configures an AddRequestParameter GatewayFilter that uses a variable:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/api/{segment}"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "AddRequestParameter=foo, bar-{segment}"
        ]
    }
]
```

### AddResponseHeader

The AddResponseHeader GatewayFilter Factory takes a name and value parameter. The following example configures an AddResponseHeader GatewayFilter:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/api/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "AddResponseHeader=X-Response-Red, Blue"
        ]
    }
]
```

This adds X-Response-Red:Blue header to the downstream response’s headers for all matching requests.

AddResponseHeader is aware of URI variables used to match a path or host. URI variables may be used in the value and are expanded at runtime. The following example configures an AddResponseHeader GatewayFilter that uses a variable:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/api/{segment}"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "AddResponseHeader=foo, bar-{segment}"
        ]
    }
]
```

### CircuitBreaker

Wraps routes in a circuit breaker.

Configuration parameters:

- `name`: circuit breaker name.
- `fallbackUri`: reroute url, can be a local route or external handler.
- `status codes`: (optional) colon-separated list of status codes to match, in number or text format.
- `failure rate`: (optional) threshold above which the circuit breaker will be opened (default 50%).
- `duration`: (optional) time to wait before closing again (default 60s).

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/api/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "CircuitBreaker=myCircuitBreaker,forward:/inCaseOfFailureUseThis,401:NOT_FOUND:500,10,30s"
        ]
    }
]
```

### DeDupeResponseHeader

The DedupeResponseHeader GatewayFilter factory takes a name parameter and an optional `strategy` parameter. `name` can contain a space-separated list of header names. The following example configures a DedupeResponseHeader GatewayFilter:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/api/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "DedupeResponseHeader=Access-Control-Allow-Credentials Access-Control-Allow-Origin"
        ]
    }
]
```

This removes duplicate values of Access-Control-Allow-Credentials and Access-Control-Allow-Origin response headers in cases when both the gateway CORS logic and the downstream logic add them.

The DedupeResponseHeader filter also accepts an optional strategy parameter. The accepted values are `RETAIN_FIRST` (default), `RETAIN_LAST`, and `RETAIN_UNIQUE`.

### FallbackHeaders

Adds any circuit breaker exception to a header.
Requires the use of the `CircuitBreaker` filter in another route.

No parameters required.

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/api/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "CircuitBreaker=myCircuitBreaker,forward:/inCaseOfFailureUseThis,401:NOT_FOUND:500,10,30s"
        ]
    },
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/inCaseOfFailureUseThis"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "FallbackHeaders"
        ]
    }
]
```

The headers with the exception type, message and (if available) root cause exception type and message are added to that request by the FallbackHeaders filter.

You can overwrite the names of the headers in the configuration by setting the values of the following arguments (shown with their default values):

- executionExceptionTypeHeaderName ("Execution-Exception-Type")
- executionExceptionMessageHeaderName ("Execution-Exception-Message")
- rootCauseExceptionTypeHeaderName ("Root-Cause-Exception-Type")
- rootCauseExceptionMessageHeaderName ("Root-Cause-Exception-Message")

### JSONToGRPC

The JSONToGRPCFilter GatewayFilter Factory converts a JSON payload to a gRPC request.

The filter takes the following arguments:

- `protoDescriptor`: Proto descriptor file.

This file can be generated using `protoc` and specifying the `--descriptor_set_out` flag:

```bash
protoc --proto_path=src/main/resources/proto/ \
    --descriptor_set_out=src/main/resources/proto/hello.pb  \
    src/main/resources/proto/hello.proto
```

> Note: `streaming` is not supported.

Here's an example of the JSONToGRPCFilter using the output from `protoc`:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/json/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "JsonToGrpc=file:proto/hello.pb,file:proto/hello.proto,HelloService,hello"
        ]
    }
]
```

### LocalResponseCache

Overrides local response cache configuration for specific routes if global cache is activated.

Configuration parameters:

- `size`: maximum allowed size of the cache entries for this route before cache eviction begins (in KB, MB and GB).
- `timeToLive`: allowed lifespan of a cache entry before expiration (use the duration suffix `s` for seconds, `m` for minutes, or `h` for hours).

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/api/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "LocalResponseCache=3m,1MB"
        ]
    }
]
```

### MapRequestHeader

The MapRequestHeader GatewayFilter factory takes fromHeader and toHeader parameters. It creates a new named header (toHeader), and the value is extracted out of an existing named header (fromHeader) from the incoming http request. If the input header does not exist, the filter has no impact. If the new named header already exists, its values are augmented with the new values. The following example configures a MapRequestHeader:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/api/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "MapRequestHeader=Blue, X-Request-Red"
        ]
    }
]
```

This adds the `X-Request-Red:<values>` header to the downstream request with updated values from the incoming HTTP request’s `Blue` header.

### PrefixPath

The PrefixPath GatewayFilter factory takes a single prefix parameter. The following example configures a PrefixPath GatewayFilter:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/catalog/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "PrefixPath=/api"
        ]
    }
]
```

This prefixes `/api` to the path of all matching requests. So a request to `/catalog` is sent to `/api/catalog`.

### PreserveHostHeader

The PreserveHostHeader GatewayFilter factory has no parameters. This filter sets a request attribute that the routing filter inspects to determine if the original host header should be sent rather than the host header determined by the HTTP client. The following example configures a PreserveHostHeader GatewayFilter:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/api/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "PreserveHostHeader"
        ]
    }
]
```

### RedirectTo

The RedirectTo GatewayFilter factory takes two parameters, status and url. The status parameter should be a 300 series redirect HTTP code, such as 301. The url parameter should be a valid URL. This is the value of the Location header. For relative redirects, you should use uri: no://op as the uri of your route definition. The following listing configures a RedirectTo GatewayFilter:

```json
[
    {
        "uri": "https://example.org",
        "filters": [
            "RedirectTo=302, https://acme.org"
        ]
    }
]
```

This will send a status `302` with a `Location:https://acme.org` header to perform a redirect.

### RemoveJsonAttributesResponseBody

Removes JSON attributes and their values from JSON response bodies.

Configuration parameters:

- `attribute names`: comma-separated list of the names of attributes to remove from a JSON response.
- `delete recursively`: (optional, boolean) configures the removal of attributes only at root level (`false`), or recursively (`true`) (default, `false`).

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/api/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "RemoveJsonAttributesResponseBody=origin,foo,true"
        ]
    }
]
```

### RemoveRequestHeader

The RemoveRequestHeader GatewayFilter factory takes a name parameter. It is the name of the header to be removed. The following listing configures a RemoveRequestHeader GatewayFilter:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/api/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "RemoveRequestHeader=X-Request-Foo"
        ]
    }
]
```

This removes the X-Request-Foo header before it is sent downstream.

### RemoveRequestParameter

The RemoveRequestParameter GatewayFilter factory takes a name parameter. It is the name of the query parameter to be removed. The following example configures a RemoveRequestParameter GatewayFilter:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/api/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "RemoveRequestParameter=red"
        ]
    }
]
```

This will remove the red parameter before it is sent downstream.

### RemoveResponseHeader

The RemoveResponseHeader GatewayFilter factory takes a name parameter. It is the name of the header to be removed. The following listing configures a RemoveResponseHeader GatewayFilter:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/api/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "RemoveResponseHeader=X-Response-Foo"
        ]
    }
]
```

This will remove the X-Response-Foo header from the response before it is returned to the gateway client.

### RequestHeaderSize

The RequestHeaderSize GatewayFilter factory takes maxSize and errorHeaderName parameters. The maxSize parameter is the maximum data size allowed by the request header (including key and value). The errorHeaderName parameter sets the name of the response header containing an error message, by default it is "errorMessage". The following listing configures a RequestHeaderSize GatewayFilter:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/api/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "RequestHeaderSize=1000B"
        ]
    }
]
```

This will send a status 431 if size of any request header is greater than 1000 Bytes.

### RewriteLocationResponseHeader

The RewriteLocationResponseHeader GatewayFilter factory modifies the value of the Location response header, usually to get rid of backend-specific details. It takes the stripVersionMode, locationHeaderName, hostValue, and protocolsRegex parameters. The following listing configures a RewriteLocationResponseHeader GatewayFilter:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/api/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "RewriteLocationResponseHeader=AS_IN_REQUEST, Location, ,"
        ]
    }
]
```

For example, for a request of `POST` `api.example.com/some/object/name`, the Location response header value of `object-service.prod.example.net/v2/some/object/id` is rewritten as `api.example.com/some/object/id`.

The `stripVersionMode` parameter has the following possible values: `NEVER_STRIP`, `AS_IN_REQUEST` (default), and `ALWAYS_STRIP`.

- `NEVER_STRIP`: The version is not stripped, even if the original request path contains no version.
- `AS_IN_REQUEST`: The version is stripped only if the original request path contains no version.
- `ALWAYS_STRIP`: The version is always stripped, even if the original request path contains version.

The `hostValue` parameter, if provided, is used to replace the `host:port` portion of the response `Location` header. If it is not provided, the value of the `Host` request header is used.

The `protocolsRegex` parameter must be a valid regex `String`, against which the protocol name is matched. If it is not matched, the filter does nothing. The default is `http|https|ftp|ftps`.

### RewritePath

The RewritePath GatewayFilter factory takes a path regexp parameter and a replacement parameter. This uses Java regular expressions for a flexible way to rewrite the request path. The following listing configures a RewritePath GatewayFilter:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/red/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "RewritePath=/red/?(?<segment>.*), /$\\{segment}"
        ]
    }
]
```

For a request path of `/red/blue`, this sets the path to `/blue` before making the downstream request.

### RewriteResponseHeader

The RewriteResponseHeader GatewayFilter factory takes name, regexp, and replacement parameters. It uses Java regular expressions for a flexible way to rewrite the response header value. The following example configures a RewriteResponseHeader GatewayFilter:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/red/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "RewriteResponseHeader=X-Response-Red, , password=[^&]+, password=***"
        ]
    }
]
```

For a header value of `/42?user=ford&password=omg!what&flag=true`, it is set to `/42?user=ford&password=***&flag=true` after making the downstream request.

### SetPath

The SetPath GatewayFilter factory takes a path template parameter. It offers a simple way to manipulate the request path by allowing templated segments of the path. This uses the URI templates from Spring Framework. Multiple matching segments are allowed. The following example configures a SetPath GatewayFilter:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/red/{segment}"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "SetPath=/{segment}"
        ]
    }
]
```

For a request path of `/red/blue`, this sets the path to `/blue` before making the downstream request

### SetRequestHeader

The SetRequestHeader GatewayFilter factory takes name and value parameters. The following listing configures a SetRequestHeader GatewayFilter:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/api/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "SetRequestHeader=X-Request-Red, Blue"
        ]
    }
]
```

This GatewayFilter replaces (rather than adding) all headers with the given name. So, if the downstream server responded with `X-Request-Red:1234`, it will be replaced with `X-Request-Red:Blue`, which is what the downstream service would receive.

SetRequestHeader is aware of URI variables used to match a path or host. URI variables may be used in the value and are expanded at runtime. The following example configures an SetRequestHeader GatewayFilter that uses a variable:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/api/{segment}"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "SetRequestHeader=foo, bar-{segment}"
        ]
    }
]
```

### SetResponseHeader

The SetResponseHeader GatewayFilter factory takes name and value parameters. The following listing configures a SetResponseHeader GatewayFilter:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/api/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "SetResponseHeader=X-Response-Red, Blue"
        ]
    }
]
```

This GatewayFilter replaces (rather than adding) all headers with the given name. So, if the downstream server responded with `X-Response-Red:1234`, it will be replaced with `X-Response-Red:Blue`, which is what the gateway client would receive.

SetResponseHeader is aware of URI variables used to match a path or host. URI variables may be used in the value and will be expanded at runtime. The following example configures an SetResponseHeader GatewayFilter that uses a variable:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/api/{segment}"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "SetResponseHeader=foo, bar-{segment}"
        ]
    }
]
```

### SetStatus

The SetStatus GatewayFilter factory takes a single parameter, status. It must be a valid Spring HttpStatus. It may be the integer value `404` or the string representation of the enumeration: `NOT_FOUND`. The following listing configures a SetStatus GatewayFilter:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/experimental/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "SetStatus=UNAUTHORIZED"
        ]
    },
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/unknown/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "SetStatus=401"
        ]
    }
]
```

### StripPrefix

The StripPrefix GatewayFilter factory takes one parameter, parts. The parts parameter indicates the number of parts in the path to strip from the request before sending it downstream. The default value of the parts parameter is 1. The following listing configures a StripPrefix GatewayFilter:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/name/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "StripPrefix=2"
        ]
    }
]
```

When a request is made through the gateway to `/name/blue/red`, the request made to `nameservice` looks like `nameservice/red`.

### Retry

The Retry GatewayFilter factory supports the following parameters:

- `retries`: The number of retries that should be attempted.
- `statuses`: The HTTP status codes that should be retried, represented by using org.springframework.http.HttpStatus.
- `methods`: The HTTP methods that should be retried, represented by using org.springframework.http.HttpMethod.
- `series`: The series of status codes to be retried, represented by using org.springframework.http.HttpStatus.Series.
- `exceptions`: A list of thrown exceptions that should be retried.
- `backoff`: The configured exponential backoff for the retries. Retries are performed after a backoff interval of `firstBackoff * (factor ^ n)`, where `n` is the iteration. If `maxBackoff` is configured, the maximum backoff applied is limited to `maxBackoff`. If `basedOnPreviousValue` is true, the `backoff` is calculated by using `prevBackoff * factor`.

The following defaults are configured for Retry filter, if enabled:

- retries: Three times
- series: 5XX series
- methods: GET method
- exceptions: IOException and TimeoutException
- backoff: disabled

The following listing configures a Retry GatewayFilter:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/api/**"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "Retry=3,INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,GET,10ms,50ms,2,false"
        ]
    }
]
```

### RequestSize

When the request size is greater than the permissible limit, the RequestSize GatewayFilter factory can restrict a request from reaching the downstream service. The filter takes a maxSize parameter. The maxSize is a DataSize type, so values can be defined as a number followed by an optional DataUnit suffix such as 'KB' or 'MB'. The default is 'B' for bytes. It is the permissible size limit of the request defined in bytes. The following listing configures a RequestSize GatewayFilter:

```json
[
    {
        "predicates": [
            "Path=/upload"
        ],
        "filters": [
            "RequestSize=5000000"
        ]
    }
]
```

The RequestSize GatewayFilter factory sets the response status as `413 Payload Too Large` with an additional header `errorMessage` when the request is rejected due to size. The following example shows such an `errorMessage`:

```bash
errorMessage : Request size is larger than permissible limit. Request size is 6.0 MB where permissible limit is 5.0 MB
```

### TokenRelay

Forwards OAuth2 access token to downstream resources. This filter is configured as a `boolean` value in the route definition rather than an explicit filter as seen in this example:

```json
