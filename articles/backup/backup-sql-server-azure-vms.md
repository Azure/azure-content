# About SQL Server Backup in Azure VMs

SQL Server databases are critical workloads that require a low recovery point objective (RPO) and long-term retention. You can backup SQL Server databases running on Azure VMs using [Azure Backup](backup-overview.md).

## Backup process

This solution leverages the SQL native APIs to take backups of your SQL databases.

* Once you specify the SQL Server VM that you want to protect and query for the databases in the it, Azure Backup service will install a workload backup extension on the VM by the name `AzureBackupWindowsWorkload` extension.
* This extension consists of a coordinator and a SQL plugin. While the coordinator is responsible for triggering workflows for various operations like configure backup, backup and restore, the plugin is responsible for actual data flow.
* To be able to discover databases on this VM, Azure Backup creates the account `NT SERVICE\AzureWLBackupPluginSvc`. This account is used for backup and restore and requires SQL sysadmin permissions. Azure Backup leverages the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account for database discovery/inquiry, so this account need to be a public login on SQL. If you didn't create the SQL Server VM from the Azure Marketplace, you might receive an error **UserErrorSQLNoSysadminMembership**. If this occurs [follow these instructions](backup-azure-sql-database.md).
* Once you trigger configure protection on the selected databases, the backup service sets up the coordinator with the backup schedules and other policy details, which the extension caches locally on the VM 
* At the scheduled time, the coordinator communicates with the plugin and it starts streaming the backup data from the SQL server using VDI.  
* The plugin sends the data directly to the recovery services vault, thus eliminating the need for a staging location. The data is encrypted and stored by the Azure Backup service in storage accounts.
* When the data transfer is complete, coordinator confirms the commit with the backup service.

## Before you start

Before you start, verify the following:

1. Make sure you have a SQL Server instance running in Azure. You can [quickly create a SQL Server instance](../virtual-machines/windows/sql/quickstart-sql-vm-create-portal.md) in the marketplace.
2. Review the [feature consideration](#feature-consideration) and [scenario support](#scenario_support).
3. [Review common questions](faq-backup-sql-server.md) about this scenario.


## Feature consideration and limitations

- The VM running SQL Server requires internet connectivity to access Azure public IP addresses.
- Backups of [distributed availability groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/distributed-availability-groups?view=sql-server-2017) groups don't fully work.
- SQL Server Always On Failover Cluster Instances (FCIs) aren't supported for backup.
- SQL Server backup should be configured in the portal or via PowerShell.
- Backup and restore operations for FCI mirror databases, database snapshots, and databases aren't supported.
- Databases with large number of files can't be protected. The maximum number of files is 1000.
- You can back up to ~2000 SQL Server databases in a vault. If you have more, create another vault.
- You can configure backup for up to 50 databases in one go; this restriction helps optimize backup loads.
- You cannot protect databases with more than 1000 files.
- Recommended database size to ensure better performance is 2TB.
- Protects up to 300 databases per server, if you have log backups configured for every 15 minutes. The number of databases can increase if the backup frequency is less frequent. We will be sharing a detailed way to calculate this shortly.
