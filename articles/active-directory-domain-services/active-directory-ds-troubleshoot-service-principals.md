# Azure AD Domain Services - Troubleshooting Service Principal Configuration

To service, manage, and update your domain, Microsoft uses various [Service Principals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-application-objects) to communicate with your tenant. If one is misconfigured or deleted, it can cause a disruption in your service. To troubleshoot when a Service Principal is deleted, please choose the ID below that matches your Service Principal's ID.

| ID Number | Solution |
| :-------- | :------- |
| id1 | [Recreating a Missing Service Principal with PowerShell](#Recreating a Missing Service Principal with PowerShell) |
| id2 | [Enabling a Misconfigured Service Principal with the Portal](#Enabling a Misconfigured Service Principal with the Portal) |
| id3 | [Service Principals that Self Correct](#Service Principals that Self Correct) |




## Recreating a Missing Service Principal with PowerShell

*For IDs: id1, id2, and id3*

You will need Azure AD PowerShell to complete these steps. For information on installing Azure AD PowerShell, see [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-adv2?view=azureadps-2.0.).

Type the following commands in a PowerShell window to address this issue:
1. Install-Module AzureAD
2. Import-Module AzureAD
3. Check whether the service principal required for Azure AD Domain Services is missing in your tenant by executing the following PowerShell command:

    `Get-AzureAdServicePrincipal -filter "AppId eq '2565bd9d-da50-47d4-8b85-4c97f669dc36'"`

4. Create the service principal by typing the following PowerShell command:

     `New-AzureAdServicePrincipal -AppId "2565bd9d-da50-47d4-8b85-4c97f669dc36"`

After you have created the missing Service Principal, check your domain's health.

>[AZURE_NOTE] NOTE: Your domain's health is checked around every hour. You will need to wait until the next check to view your changes.

## Enabling a Misconfigured Service Principal with the Portal

*For IDs: id7 and id8*

Follow the steps below to restore Domain Services on your tenant:

1. Travel and login to the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com)

2. Click on **Azure Active Directory** in the left-hand navigation blade

3. Click on **Enterprise Application** in the Azure Active Directory navigation.

4. Navigate to **All Applications** using the navigation panel.

5. In the All Applications blade, filter the applications to show *Microsoft Applications* using the Show filter. Click **Apply**.

6. Search for the application with the ID xxxxxxxxxxxx and click on the row to take you to that application's overview.

7. Click **Properties**.

8. Check to see if you have disabled the toggle that says "Enable for users to sign-in?".

5. Re-enable the application by toggling to "Yes".

6. Re-enable Azure AD Domain Services.



## Service Principals that Self Correct

*For IDs: id4, id5, and id6*

Microsoft can identify when specific Service Principals are missing, misconfigured, or deleted. To remedy this quickly, Microsoft will recreate the Service Principals itself.
