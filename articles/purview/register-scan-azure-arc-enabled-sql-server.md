# Connect to and manage an Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server instance in Microsoft Purview (Public preview)

[!INCLUDE [feature-in-preview](includes/feature-in-preview.md)]

This article outlines how to register Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server instances, and how to authenticate and interact with an Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server instance in Microsoft Purview. For more information about Microsoft Purview, read the [introductory article](overview.md).

## Supported capabilities

|**Metadata Extraction**|  **Full Scan**  |**Incremental Scan**|**Scoped Scan**|**Classification**|**Access Policy**|**Lineage**|**Data Sharing**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Yes](#register) | [Yes](#scan) | [Yes](#scan) | [Yes](#scan) | [Yes](#scan) | [Yes](#access-policy) | Limited** | No |

\** Lineage is supported if dataset is used as a source/sink in [Data Factory Copy activity](how-to-link-azure-data-factory.md) 

The supported SQL Server versions are 2012 and above. SQL Server Express LocalDB is not supported.

When scanning Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server, Microsoft Purview supports:

- Extracting technical metadata including:

    - Instance
    - Databases
    - Schemas
    - Tables including the columns
    - Views including the columns

When setting up scan, you can choose to specify the database name to scan one database, and you can further scope the scan by selecting tables and views as needed. The whole Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server will be scanned if database name is not provided.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* An active [Microsoft Purview account](create-catalog-portal.md).

* You will need to be a Data Source Administrator and Data Reader to register a source and manage it in the Microsoft Purview governance portal. See our [Microsoft Purview Permissions page](catalog-permissions.md) for details.

* Set up the latest [self-hosted integration runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39717). For more information, seeÂ [the create and configure a self-hosted integration runtime guide](manage-integration-runtimes.md).

## Register

This section describes how to register an Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server instance in Microsoft Purview using the [Microsoft Purview governance portal](https://web.purview.azure.com/).

### Authentication for registration

There are two ways to set up authentication for scanning Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server with self-hosted integration runtime:

- SQL Authentication
- Windows Authentication

#### Set up SQL server authentication

If SQL Authentication is applied, ensure the SQL Server deployment is configured to allow SQL Server and Windows Authentication.

To enable this, within SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), navigate to "Server Properties" and change from "Windows Authentication Mode" to "SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode".

:::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-arc-enabled-sql-server/enable-sql-server-authentication.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the open Server Properties window. The security page is selected. Under Server authentication, SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode is selected.":::

If Windows Authentication is applied, configure the SQL Server deployment to use Windows Authentication mode.

A change to the Server Authentication will require a restart of the SQL Server Instance and SQL Server Agent, this can be triggered within SSMS by navigating to the SQL Server instance and selecting "Restart" within the right-click options pane.

##### Creating a new login and user

If you would like to create a new login and user to be able to scan your SQL server, follow the steps below:

The account must have access to the **master** database. This is because the `sys.databases` is in the master database. The Microsoft Purview scanner needs to enumerate `sys.databases` in order to find all the SQL databases on the server.

> [!Note]
> All the steps below can be executed using the code provided [here](https://github.com/Azure/Purview-Samples/blob/master/TSQL-Code-Permissions/grant-access-to-on-prem-sql-databases.sql)

1. Navigate to SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), connect to the server, navigate to security, select and hold (or right-click) on login and create New login. If Windows Authentication is applied, select "Windows authentication". If SQL Authentication is applied, make sure to select "SQL authentication".

   :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-arc-enabled-sql-server/create-new-login-user.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to create a new login and user.":::

1. Select Server roles on the left navigation and ensure that public role is assigned.

1. Select User mapping on the left navigation, select all the databases in the map and select the Database role: **db_datareader**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-arc-enabled-sql-server/user-mapping.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows user mapping.":::

1. Select OK to save.

1. If SQL Authentication is applied, navigate again to the user you created, by selecting and holding (or right-clicking) and selecting **Properties**. Enter a new password and confirm it. Select the 'Specify old password' and enter the old password. **It is required to change your password as soon as you create a new login.**

   :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-arc-enabled-sql-server/change-password.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to change a password.":::

##### Storing your SQL login password in a key vault and creating a credential in Microsoft Purview

1. Navigate to your key vault in the Azure portal1. Select **Settings > Secrets**
1. Select **+ Generate/Import** and enter the **Name** and **Value** as the *password* from your SQL server login
1. Select **Create** to complete
1. If your key vault is not connected to Microsoft Purview yet, you will need to [create a new key vault connection](manage-credentials.md#create-azure-key-vaults-connections-in-your-microsoft-purview-account)
1. Finally, [create a new credential](manage-credentials.md#create-a-new-credential) using the **username** and **password** to set up your scan. Make sure the right authentication method is selected when creating a new credential. If SQL Authentication is applied, select "SQL authentication" as the authentication method. If Windows Authentication is applied, then select "Windows authentication".

### Steps to register

1. Navigate to your Microsoft Purview account

1. Under Sources and scanning in the left navigation, select **Integration runtimes**. Make sure a self-hosted integration runtime is set up. If it is not set up, follow the steps mentioned [here](manage-integration-runtimes.md) to create a self-hosted integration runtime for scanning on an on-premises or Azure VM that has access to your on-premises network.

1. Select **Data Map** on the left navigation.

1. Select **Register**

1. Select **SQL server on Azure Arc-enabled servers** and then **Continue**

## Access policy

### Supported policies
The following types of policies are supported on this data resource from Microsoft Purview:
- [DevOps policies](concept-policies-devops.md)
- [Data owner policies](concept-policies-data-owner.md)

### Access policy pre-requisites on Arc enabled SQL Server
[!INCLUDE [Access policies Arc enabled SQL Server pre-requisites](./includes/access-policies-prerequisites-arc-sql-server.md)]

### Configure the Microsoft Purview account for policies
[!INCLUDE [Access policies generic configuration](./includes/access-policies-configuration-generic.md)]

### Register the data source and enable Data use management
The Arc-enabled SQL Server data source needs to be registered first with Microsoft Purview, before policies can be created.

1. Sign in to Microsoft Purview Studio.

1. Navigate to the **Data map** feature on the left pane, select **Sources**, then select **Register**. Type "Azure Arc" in the search box and select **SQL Server on Azure Arc**. Then select **Continue**
![Screenshot shows how to select a source for registration.](./media/how-to-policies-data-owner-sql/select-arc-sql-server-for-registration.png)

1. Enter a **Name** for this registration. It is best practice to make the name of the registration the same as the server name in the next step.

1. select an **Azure subscription**, **Server name** and **Server endpoint**.

1. **Select a collection** to put this registration in. 

1. Enable Data Use Management. Data Use Management needs certain permissions and can affect the security of your data, as it delegates to certain Microsoft Purview roles to manage access to the data sources. **Go through the secure practices related to Data Use Management in this guide**: [How to enable Data Use Management](./how-to-enable-data-use-management.md)

1. Upon enabling Data Use Management, Microsoft Purview will automatically capture the **Application ID** of the App Registration related to this Arc-enabled SQL server. Come back to this screen and hit the refresh button on the side of it to refresh, in case the association between the Arc-enabled SQL server and the App Registration changes in the future.

1. Select **Register** or **Apply** at the bottom

Once your data source has the **Data Use Management** toggle *Enabled*, it will look like this picture. 
![Screenshot shows how to register a data source for policy.](./media/how-to-policies-data-owner-sql/register-data-source-for-policy-arc-sql.png)

### Create a policy
To create an access policy for Arc-enabled SQL Server, follow these guides:
* [DevOps policy on a single Arc-enabled SQL Server](./how-to-policies-devops-arc-sql-server.md#create-a-new-devops-policy)
* [Data owner policy on a single Arc-enabled SQL Server](./how-to-policies-data-owner-arc-sql-server.md#create-and-publish-a-data-owner-policy) - This guide will allow you to provision access on a single Arc-enabled SQL Server in your subscription.
* [Data owner policy covering all sources in a subscription or resource group](./how-to-policies-data-owner-resource-group.md) - This guide will allow you to provision access on all enabled data sources in a resource group, or across an Azure subscription. The pre-requisite is that the subscription or resource group is registered with the Data use management option enabled.
