# Microsoft Security Copilot in Defender EASM

Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management (Defender EASM) continuously discovers and maps your digital attack surface to provide an external view of your online infrastructure. This visibility enables security and IT teams to identify unknowns, prioritize risk, eliminate threats, and extend vulnerability and exposure control beyond the firewall. Attack Surface Insights are generated by analyzing vulnerability and infrastructure data to showcase the key areas of concern for your organization. 

Defender EASM’s integration with Microsoft Security Copilot enables users to interact with Microsoft’s discovered attack surfaces. These attack surfaces allow users to quickly understand their externally facing infrastructure and relevant, critical risks to their organization. They provide insight into specific areas of risk, including vulnerabilities, compliance, and security hygiene. For more information about Microsoft Security Copilot, go to [What is Microsoft Security Copilot](/security-copilot/microsoft-security-copilot).  For more information on the embedded Microsoft Security Copilot experience, refer to [Query your attack surface with Defender EASM using Microsoft Copilot in Azure](/azure/copilot/query-attack-surface).

## Microsoft Security Copilot integration in Defender EASM

Microsoft Security Copilot can surface insights from Defender EASM about an organization's attack surface. You can use the system features built into Microsoft Security Copilot, and use prompts to get more information. This information can help you understand your security posture and mitigate vulnerabilities.

This article introduces you to Microsoft Security Copilot and includes sample prompts that can help Defender EASM users.

## Key features

The EASM Security Copilot integration can help you with:

- Providing a snapshot of your external attack surface and generating insights into potential risks

  This allows users to get a quick view of their external attack surface by analyzing internet-available information combined with Microsoft's proprietary discovery algorithm. It provides an easy-to-understand natural language explanation of the organization's externally facing assets, such as hosts, domains, webpages, and IP addresses, and highlights the critical risks associated with them.

- Prioritizing remediation efforts based on asset risk and CVEs

  EASM allows security teams to prioritize their remediation efforts by understanding which assets and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) pose the greatest risk in their environment. It does this by analyzing vulnerability and infrastructure data to showcase key areas of concern, providing a natural language explanation of the risks and recommended actions.

- Leveraging Security Copilot to surface insights

  Users can leverage Security Copilot to ask about insights in natural language to extract insights from Defender EASM about their organization's attack surface. This includes querying details such as the number of insecure SSL certificates, ports detected, and specific vulnerabilities impacting the attack surface.

- Expediting Attack Surface Curation

  Utilize Security Copilot to curate your attack surface with labels, external IDs, and state modifications for a set of assets. This process speeds up curation, allowing you to organize your inventory faster and more efficiently.

> Customers can still use Defender EASM skills if they have not purchased Defender EASM. See the Plugin capabilities reference section for more information. 




## Sample Defender EASM prompts

Microsoft Security Copilot operates primarily with natural language prompts. When querying information from Defender EASM, you submit a prompt that guides Microsoft Security Copilot to select the Defender EASM plugin and invoke the relevant capability.  
For success with Copilot prompts, we recommend the following: 

- Ensure that you reference the company name in your first prompt. Unless otherwise specified, all future prompts will provide data about the initially specified company. 

- Be clear and specific with your prompts. You might get better results if you include specific asset names or metadata values (for example, CVE IDs) in your prompts.

  It might also help to add **Defender EASM** to your prompt, like:

  - **According to Defender EASM, what are my expired domains?**
  - **Tell me about Defender EASM high priority attack surface insights.**

- Experiment with different prompts and variations to see what works best for your use case. Chat AI models vary, so iterate and refine your prompts based on the results you receive.

- Microsoft Security Copilot saves your prompt sessions. To see the previous sessions, in Microsoft Security Copilot, go to the menu > **My sessions**.

### Switching between resource and company data 

Even though we have added resource integration for our skills, we still support pulling data from prebuilt attack surfaces for specific companies. To improve Security Copilot’s accuracy in determining when a customer wants to pull from their attack surface or a prebuilt, company attack surface, we recommend using “my”, “my attack surface”, etc. to convey they want to use their resource and “their”, “{specific company name}”, etc. to convey they want a prebuilt attack surface. While this does improve the experience in a single session, we strongly recommend having two separate sessions to avoid any confusion. 


## Provide feedback

Your feedback on Microsoft Security Copilot generally, and the Defender EASM plugin specifically, is vital to guide current and planned development on the product. The optimal way to provide this feedback is directly in the product, using the feedback buttons at the bottom of each completed prompt. Select "Looks right," "Needs improvement" or "Inappropriate". We recommend “Looks right” when the result matches expectations, “Needs improvement” when it doesn't, and “Inappropriate” when the result is harmful in some way.  

Whenever possible, and especially when the result is “Needs improvement,” please write a few words explaining what we can do to improve the outcome. This also applies when you expected Microsoft Security Copilot to invoke the Defender EASM plugin, but another plugin was selected instead. 



## Privacy and data security in Microsoft Security Copilot

When you interact with Microsoft Security Copilot to get Defender EASM data, Copilot pulls that data from Defender EASM. The prompts, the data that's retrieved, and the output shown in the prompt results is processed and stored within the Microsoft Security Copilot service.
