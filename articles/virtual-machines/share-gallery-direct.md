# Share a gallery with subscriptions or tenants (preview)

This article covers how to share an Azure Compute Gallery with specific subscriptions or tenants using a direct shared gallery. Sharing a gallery with tenants and subscriptions give them read-only access to your gallery.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Compute Gallery â€“ direct shared gallery is currently in PREVIEW and subject to the [Preview Terms for Azure Compute Gallery](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).
>
> To publish images to a direct shared gallery during the preview, you need to register at [https://aka.ms/directsharedgallery-preview](https://aka.ms/directsharedgallery-preview). Creating VMs from a direct shared gallery is open to all Azure users.
>
> During the preview, you need to create a new gallery, with the property `sharingProfile.permissions` set to `Groups`. When using the CLI to create a gallery, use the `--permissions groups` parameter. You can't use an existing gallery, the property can't currently be updated.



There are three main ways to share images in an Azure Compute Gallery, depending on who you want to share with:

| Share with\: | Option |
|----|----|
| [Specific people, groups, or service principals](./share-gallery.md) | Role-based access control (RBAC) lets you share resources to specific people, groups, or service principals on a granular level. |
| [Subscriptions or tenants](explained in this article) | Direct shared gallery lets you share to everyone in a subscription or tenant. |
| [Everyone](./share-gallery-community.md) | Community gallery lets you share your entire gallery publicly, to all Azure users. |


## Limitations

During the preview:
- You can only share to subscriptions that are also in the preview.
- You can only share to 30 subscriptions and 5 tenants.
- Only images can be shared. You can't directly share a [VM application](vm-applications.md) during the preview.
- A direct shared gallery can't contain encrypted image versions. Encrypted images can't be created within a gallery that is directly shared.
- Only the owner of a subscription, or a user or service principal assigned to the `Compute Gallery Sharing Admin` role at the subscription or gallery level will be able to enable group-based sharing.
- You need to create a new gallery,  with the property `sharingProfile.permissions` set to `Groups`. When using the CLI to create a gallery, use the `--permissions groups` parameter. You can't use an existing gallery, the property can't currently be updated.
- PowerShell, Ansible, and Terraform aren't supported at this time.
- **Known issue**: When creating a VM from a direct shared image using the Azure portal, if you select a region, select an image, then change the region, you will get an error message: "You can only create VM in the replication regions of this image" even when the image is replicated to that region. To get rid of the error, select a different region, then switch back to the region you want. If the image is available, it should clear the error message.

## Prerequisites

You need to create a [new direct shared gallery ](./create-gallery.md#create-a-direct-shared-gallery). A direct shared gallery has the `sharingProfile.permissions` property is set to `Groups`. When using the CLI to create a gallery, use the `--permissions groups` parameter. You can't use an existing gallery, the property can't currently be updated.
### [Portal](#tab/portaldirect)

1. Sign in to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com.
1. Type **Azure Compute Gallery** in the search box and select **Azure Compute Gallery** in the results.


### [CLI](#tab/clidirect)

To create a direct shared gallery, you need to create the gallery with the `--permissions` parameter set to `groups`.

```azurecli-interactive
az sig create \
   --gallery-name myGallery \
   --permissions groups \
   --resource-group myResourceGroup  
```
 

To start sharing the gallery with a subscription or tenant, use [az sig share add](/cli/azure/sig#az-sig-share-add) 

```azurecli-interactive
sub=<subscription-id>
tenant=<tenant-id>
gallery=<gallery-name>
rg=<resource-group-name>
az sig share add \
   --subscription-ids $sub \
   --tenant-ids $tenant \
   --gallery-name $gallery \
   --resource-group $rg
```
 

Remove access for a subscription or tenant using [az sig share remove](/cli/azure/sig#az-sig-share-remove).

```azurecli-interactive
sub=<subscription-id>
tenant=<tenant-id>
gallery=<gallery-name>
rg=<resource-group-name>

az sig share remove \
   --subscription-ids $sub \
   --tenant-ids $tenant \
   --gallery-name $gallery \
   --resource-group $rg
```
 


 
### [REST](#tab/restdirect)

Create a gallery for subscription or tenant-level sharing using the Azure REST API.

```rest
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{rgName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/{gallery-name}?api-version=2020-09-30

{
	"properties": {
		"sharingProfile": {
			"permissions": "Groups"
		}
	},
	"location": "{location}
}
 
```


Share a gallery to subscription or tenant.


```rest
POST https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{rgName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/{galleryName}/share?api-version=2020-09-30

{
  "operationType": "Add",
  "groups": [
    {
      "type": "Subscriptions",
      "ids": [
        "{SubscriptionID}"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "AADTenants",
      "ids": [
        "{tenantID}"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```
 

Remove access for a subscription or tenant.

```rest
POST https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{rgName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/{galleryName}/share?api-version=2020-09-30

{
	"operationType": "Remove",
	"groups":[ 
		{
			"type": "Subscriptions",
			"ids": [
				"{subscriptionId1}",
				"{subscriptionId2}"
			],
},
{
			"type": "AADTenants",
			"ids": [
				"{tenantId1}",
				"{tenantId2}"
			]
		}
	]
}

```


Reset sharing to clear everything in the `sharingProfile`.

```rest
POST https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{rgName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/{galleryName}/share?api-version=2020-09-30 

{ 
 "operationType" : "Reset", 
} 
```

## Next steps
- Create an [image definition and an image version](image-version.md).
- Create a VM from a [generalized](vm-generalized-image-version.md#create-a-vm-from-a-community-gallery-image) or [specialized](vm-specialized-image-version.md#create-a-vm-from-a-community-gallery-image) image in a direct shared gallery.
