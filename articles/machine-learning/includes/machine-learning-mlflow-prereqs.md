- Install the MLflow SDK package `mlflow` and the Azure Machine Learning `azureml-mlflow` plug-in for MLflow: 

   ```bash
   pip install mlflow azureml-mlflow
   ```
    
   > [!TIP]
   > You can use the [`mlflow-skinny`](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/README_SKINNY.rst) package, which is a lightweight MLflow package without SQL storage, server, UI, or data science dependencies. `mlflow-skinny` is recommended for users who primarily need the MLflow tracking and logging capabilities without importing the full suite of features, including deployments.

- An Azure Machine Learning workspace. To create a workspace, see the [Create machine learning resources tutorial](../quickstart-create-resources.md). Review the [access permissions you need to perform your MLflow operations in your workspace](../how-to-assign-roles.md#mlflow-operations).

- If you perform remote tracking (that is, track experiments running outside Azure Machine Learning), configure MLflow to point to the tracking URI of your Azure Machine Learning workspace. For more information on how to connect MLflow to your workspace, see [Configure MLflow for Azure Machine Learning](../how-to-use-mlflow-configure-tracking.md).
