# Deploy a large Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster

This article provides the steps and best practices for deploying large scale Azure Red Hat OpenShift clusters up to 250 worker nodes. For clusters of that size, there are some recommendations regarding control plane nodes and infrastructure nodes.

> [!CAUTION]
> Before deleting a cluster with more than 120 nodes, please scale down the cluster to 120 nodes or less.
> 

## Recommendations 

### Control plane nodes

For clusters with over 100 worker nodes, the following [virtual machine instance types](support-policies-v4.md#supported-virtual-machine-sizes) (or similar, newer generation instance types) are recommended for control plane nodes:

- Standard_D32s_v3
- Standard_D32s_v4
- Standard_D32s_v5

### Infrastructure nodes

For clusters with over 100 worker nodes, infrastructure nodes are required to separate cluster workloads (such as prometheus) to minimize contention with other workloads. It is recommended that you deploy three (3) infrastructure nodes per cluster for redundancy and scalability needs.

The following instance types are recommended for infrastructure nodes:

- Standard_E16as_v5
- Standard_E16s_v5

For instructions on configuring infrastructure nodes, see [Deploy infrastructure nodes in an Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster](howto-infrastructure-nodes.md). This will be configured after cluster deployment.

### Add IP addresses to the load balancer

ARO public clusters are created with a public load balancer that's used for outbound connectivity from inside the cluster. By default, one public IP address is configured on that public load balancer, and that limits the maximum node count of your cluster to 62. To be able to scale your cluster to the maximum supported number of 250 nodes, you need to assign multiple additional public IP addresses to the load balancer. You can configure up to 20 IP addresses per cluster. The outbound rules and frontend IP configurations are adjusted to accommodate the number of IP addresses.

For example, if you'd like a cluster with 180 worker nodes, you will need at least 3 IP addresses (180 nodes / 62 nodes per IP).

This can be accomplished as part of the cluster creation process or later, after the cluster is created.

## Deploy a cluster

> [!NOTE]
> When deploying a large cluster you must start with at most 50 worker nodes at creation time, then scale the cluster out to the desired number of worker nodes up to 250 worker nodes. 
> 

> [!NOTE]
> While you can define up to 50 worker nodes at creation time, it is a best practice to start with a small cluster (e.g, 3 worker nodes as the default) and then scale to the desired number of worker nodes after the cluster is installed.

Please follow the steps listed on the [Create an Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/openshift/create-cluster?tabs=azure-cli) page until the "Create the cluster" steps then continue below.

For large clusters the reccomendations above should be followed.  Therefore the sample command below using the Azure CLI can be used to deploy a cluster with Standard_D32s_v5 as the control plane nodes, request 3 public IP addresses, and define 9 worker nodes:

```azurecli
az aro create \ 
    --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
    --name $CLUSTER \
    --vnet aro-vnet \
    --master-subnet master-subnet \
    --worker-subnet worker-subnet \
    --master-vm-size Standard_D32s_v5 \
    --worker-count 9 \
    --lb-ip-count 3
```

To add IP addresses to the load balancer using the Azure CLI after the cluster is created, run the following command:

`az aro update --name <CLUSTER_NAME> â€“-resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --lb-ip-count <PUBLIC_IP_COUNT>`

You can then configure the corresponding OpenShift MachineSets to obtain the number of worker nodes desired. See [Manually scaling a compute machine set](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/machine_management/manually-scaling-machineset.html) for more details.

After the cluster is successfully installed please proceed to deploying infrastructure nodes as defined in the [Infrastructure nodes](#infrastructure-nodes) section above.
