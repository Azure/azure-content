## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription.
- A deployed [Communication Service resource](../../../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md) and valid connection string found by selecting Keys in left side menu on Azure portal.
- [Acquire a PSTN phone number from the Communication Service resource](../../../quickstarts/telephony/get-phone-number.md). Note the phone number you acquired to use in this quickstart. 
- The latest [.NET library](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) for your operating system.

## Create a new C# application

In the console window of your operating system, use the `dotnet` command to create a new web application with the name 'IncomingCallRedirect':

```console
 dotnet new web -n IncomingCallRedirect 
```

## Install the NuGet package

During the preview phase, the NuGet package can be obtained by configuring your package manager to use the [Azure SDK Dev Feed](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#nuget-package-dev-feed)

Install the NuGet packages: [Azure.Communication.CallAutomation](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_artifacts/feed/azure-sdk-for-net/NuGet/Azure.Communication.CallAutomation/versions/) and [Azure.Messaging.EventGrid](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_artifacts/feed/azure-sdk-for-net/NuGet/Azure.Messaging.EventGrid/versions/) to your project. 
```console 
dotnet add <path-to-project> package Azure.Communication.CallAutomation --prerelease
dotnet add <path-to-project> package Azure.Messaging.EventGrid --prerelease
```

## Set up a public URI for the local application
In this quick-start, you'll use Ngrok tool to project a public URI to the local port so that your local application can be visited by the internet. The public URI is needed to receive the Event Grid IncomingCall event and Call Automation events using webhooks.

First, determine the port of the .NET application. Minimal API dynamically allocates a port for the project at the time of creation. Find out the http port in <PROJECT_ROOT>\Properties\launchSettings.json. 
![Screenshot of demo application's launchsetting.json file.](../../../quickstarts/voice-video-calling/media/call-automation/dotnet-application-port.jpg)

Then, install Ngrok and run Ngrok with the following command: ngrok http <replace_with_port>. This command will create a public URI like https://ff2f-75-155-253-232.ngrok.io/, and it is your Ngrok Fully Qualified Domain Name(Ngrok_FQDN). Keep Ngrok running while following the rest of this quick-start.

## Configure Program.cs to redirect the call

Using the minimal API feature in .NET 6, we can easily add an HTTP POST map and redirect the call.

In this code snippet, /api/incomingCall is the default route that will be used to listen for incoming calls. At a later step, you'll register this url with Event Grid. Since Event Grid requires you to prove ownership of your Webhook endpoint before it starts delivering events to that endpoint, the code sample also handles this one time validation by processing SubscriptionValidationEvent. This requirement prevents a malicious user from flooding your endpoint with events. For more information, see this [guide](../../../../event-grid/webhook-event-delivery.md).

```csharp
using Azure.Communication;
using Azure.Communication.CallAutomation;
using Azure.Messaging.EventGrid;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using System.Text.Json;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var client = new CallAutomationClient("<resource_connection_string_obtained_in_pre-requisites>");

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapPost("/api/incomingCall", async (
    [FromBody] EventGridEvent[] eventGridEvents) =>
    {
        foreach (var eventGridEvent in eventGridEvents)
        {
            if (eventGridEvent.TryGetSystemEventData(out object eventData))
            {
                // Handle the subscription validation event.
                if (eventData is SubscriptionValidationEventData subscriptionValidationEventData)
                {
                    var responseData = new SubscriptionValidationResponse
                    {
                        ValidationResponse = subscriptionValidationEventData.ValidationCode
                    };
                    return Results.Ok(responseData);
                }
            }
            
            var jsonObject = JsonNode.Parse(eventGridEvent.Data).AsObject();
            var incomingCallContext = (string)jsonObject["incomingCallContext"];
            await client.RedirectCallAsync(incomingCallContext, new PhoneNumberIdentifier("<phone_number_to_redirect_call_to")); //this can be any phone number you have access to and should be provided in format +(countrycode)(phonenumber)
        }

        return Results.Ok();
    });

app.Run();
```
Update the placeholders in the code above for connection string and phone number to redirect to. 

## Run the app
Open Your_Project_Name.csproj file in your project with Visual Studio, and then select Run button or press F5 on your keyboard.
