# Azure API Management Diagnostics overview

When you build and manage an API in Azure API Management, you want to be prepared for any issues that may arise, from 404 not found errors to 502 bad gateway error. API Management Diagnostics is an intelligent and interactive experience to help you troubleshoot your API Management service with no configuration required. When you run into issues with your published APIs, API Management Diagnostics points out whatâ€™s wrong, and guides you to the right information to quickly troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

## Open API Management Diagnostics

To access API Management Diagnostics, navigate to your API Management service instance in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). In the left navigation, select **Diagnose and solve problems**.

## Intelligent search

You can search your issues or problems in the search bar on the top of the page. The search also helps you find the tools that may help to troubleshoot or resolve your issues.

## Troubleshooting categories

You can troubleshoot issues under categories. Common issues that are related to your API performance, gateway, API policies, and service tier can all be analyzed within each category. Each category also provides more specific diagnostics checks.

### Availability and performance

Check your API availability and performance issues under this category. After selecting this category tile, you will see an overview of your API Management instance's availability. You can click on any of the cards to dive deep to the specifics of each issue. The check will also provide you multiple graphs, including one that gives you the ability to compare the responses on the gateway vs the backend.

### API policies

This category detects errors and show you solutions for policy issues. 

A similar interactive interface guides you to the data metrics to help you troubleshoot your API policies configuration.

### Gateway performance 

For gateway requests or responses or any 4xx or 5xx errors on your gateway, use this category to diagnose and troubleshoot. Similarly, leverage the interactive interface to dive deep on the specific area that you want to check for your API gateway performance.

### Service upgrade

This category checks which service tier (SKU) you are currently using and reminds you to upgrade to avoid any issues that may be related to that tier. The same interactive interface helps you go deep with more graphics and a summary check result.

## Search documentation

In addition to the diagnostic tools, you can search for documentation related to your issue. Towards the end of the diagnostics, you'll find an option to describe your problem so we can recommend relevant docs related to your issue.
