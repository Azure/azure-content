# Microsoft Azure Network Adapter (MANA) and DPDK on Linux

MANA is a departure from the previous DPDK devices available on Azure. 
It enables high throughput and reliablity; however, it breaks some assumptions about devices and NIC configurations. 
The MANA PMD requires a different set of EAL arugments and requires the Linux kernel release the network devices before use.
