# Call Recording API Quickstart
Get started with Azure Communication Services by using the Communication Services Calling server SDKs to develop call recording features.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
[!INCLUDE [Build Call Recording server sample with C#](./includes/call-recording-samples/recording-server-csharp.md)]
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"
[!INCLUDE [Build Call Recording server sample with Java](./includes/call-recording-samples/recording-server-java.md)]
::: zone-end

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it. Learn more about [cleaning up resources](../create-communication-resource.md#clean-up-resources).
