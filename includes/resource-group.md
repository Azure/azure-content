A [resource group](../articles/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview.md#terminology) is simply a way to group resources like web apps, databases and storage accounts within Azure so that they can all be managed together. If you don't already have a resource group or you don't know what a resource group is, simply create a new one. Having multiple resource groups does not directly affect price and you can always move items between resource groups at a later time.
