# Connect data sources

Once you have enabled Azure Sentinel, the first thing you need to do is connect your data sources. Azure Sentinel comes with a number of connectors for Microsoft solutions, available out of the box and providing real-time integration, including Microsoft 365 Defender (formerly Microsoft Threat Protection) solutions, Microsoft 365 sources (including Office 365), Azure AD, Microsoft Defender for Identity (formerly Azure ATP), Microsoft Cloud App Security, and more. In addition, there are built-in connectors to the broader security ecosystem for non-Microsoft solutions. You can also use Common Event Format (CEF), Syslog or REST-API to connect your data sources with Azure Sentinel.

1. On the menu, select **Data connectors**. This page lets you see the full list of connectors that Azure Sentinel provides and their status. Select the connector you want to connect and select **Open connector page**.

1. On the specific connector page, make sure you have fulfilled all the prerequisites and follow the instructions to connect the data to Azure Sentinel. It may take some time for the logs to start syncing with Azure Sentinel. After you connect, you see a summary of the data in the **Data received** graph, and connectivity status of the data types.

## Data connection methods

The following data connection methods are supported by Azure Sentinel:

- **Service to service integration**:<br> Some services are connected natively, such as AWS and Microsoft services, these services leverage the Azure foundation for out-of-the box integration.

- **External solutions via API**: Some data sources are connected using APIs that are provided by the connected data source. Typically, most security technologies provide a set of APIs through which event logs can be retrieved. The APIs connect to Azure Sentinel and gather specific data types and send them to Azure Log Analytics.

- **External solutions via agent**: Azure Sentinel can be connected via an agent to any other data source that can perform real-time log streaming using the Syslog protocol.

    Most appliances use the Syslog protocol to send event messages that include the log itself and data about the log. The format of the logs varies, but most appliances support CEF-based formatting for log data. 

    The Azure Sentinel agent, which is actually the Log Analytics agent, converts CEF-formatted logs into a format that can be ingested by Log Analytics. Depending on the appliance type, the agent is installed either directly on the appliance, or on a dedicated Linux-based log forwarder. The agent for Linux receives events from the Syslog daemon over UDP, but if a Linux machine is expected to collect a high volume of Syslog events, they are sent over TCP from the Syslog daemon to the agent and from there to Log Analytics.

    
## Agent connection options<a name="agent-options"></a>

To connect your external appliance to Azure Sentinel, the agent must be deployed on a dedicated machine (VM or on premises) to support the communication between the appliance and Azure Sentinel. You can deploy the agent automatically or manually. Automatic deployment is only available if your dedicated machine is a new VM you are creating in Azure.

Alternatively, you can deploy the agent manually on an existing Azure VM, on a VM in another cloud, or on an on-premises machine.
