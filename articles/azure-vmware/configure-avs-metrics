# Leveraging the improved private cloud metrics for Azure VMware Solution

Azure VMware Solution provides users with an array of high-level metrics available for consumption in the Azure VMware Solution portal that provide visibility into the health and performance of an Azure VMware Solution private cloud. As of March 2024, another set of identical metrics labeled with the word "(new)" were introduced, where a series of enhancements to the stability, reliability, and performance of these metrics were made to provide users a better experience relative to the older set of metrics. 
  
In this article, learn how to leverage the new and improved metrics available to monitor your Azure VMware Solution private cloud.

### Azure VMware Solution metrics
From your Azure VMware Solution private cloud, select **Metrics**, then under the **Metric** dropdown, choose a metric that contains the word "(new)" These newer metrics are powered by our improved metrics engine, providing utmost reliability and stability. Here, you can see metrics that allow you to monitor crucial things like memory consumption, datastore usage, and CPU across your Azure VMware Solution private cloud.

#### Setting up a chart

Select a metric you'd like to build a chart for, such as "Percentage CPU (new)" in this example. Upon doing so, you will see a chart like the one below showing a time series for the metric you've selected.

You can toggle the time window you are interested in this metric for by simply selecting the time window button in the top-right corner. The default window for your selected metric will be **24 hours**.

Once you are ready to save, click **Save to Dashboard** and select one of the options presented for where this metric will live. 

#### Sending metrics to a third-party tool 

Additionally, you can hover over each metric in the **Metric** dropdown to see the Metric ID. You can use this Metric ID in your third-party telemetry tools to monitor your Azure VMware Solution private cloud.
 >[!IMPORTANT]
   >For **first time users** of these metrics, please use the metrics suffixed with **"(new)"**. If you have used these metrics before, we encourage all users to migrate to the new ones suffixed with **"(new)"** as well.

For those who have used the metrics previously and have built monitoring in downstream tools that rely on the old metric IDs, here is a table that contains the corresponding newer metric IDs that can be used for the same set of metrics: 

| Metric Name (as viewed in the portal) | Current Metric ID | New Metric ID |
