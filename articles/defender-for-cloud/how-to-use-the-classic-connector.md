# Manage classic cloud connectors (retired)

The retired *classic cloud connector* requires configuration in your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project or Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to create a user that Microsoft Defender for Cloud can use to connect to your GCP project or AWS environment. The classic connector is available only to customers who previously used it to connect GCP projects or AWS environments.

To connect a [GCP project](quickstart-onboard-gcp.md) or an [AWS account](quickstart-onboard-aws.md), you should use the native connector available in Defender for Cloud.
