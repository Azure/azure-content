# Write a customization file for Dev Box
In this article, you learn how to create and test a customization file for your dev box using Visual Studio Code and Dev Home. 

There are two ways to use a customization file: team customizations which apply automatically once configured on a pool, and individual customizations which are applied when a user creates a dev box.

This article helps you define new tasks in your customization file, apply them to your dev boxes, and test these customizations directly in Visual Studio Code. 

[!INCLUDE [customizations-preview-text](includes/customizations-preview-text.md)]

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this article, you must:
- Have a [dev center configured with a dev box definition, dev box pool, and dev box project](./quickstart-configure-dev-box-service.md) configured so that you can create a dev box. 
- Be a member of the Dev Box Users security group for at least one project.
- Have a catalog attached to the dev center with tasks that you can use in your customization file. 
    - If you don't have a catalog, see [Add and configure a catalog from GitHub or Azure Repos](../deployment-environments/how-to-configure-catalog.md).

## Permissions required to configure customizations

## What is a customization file?
Dev Box customizations use a yaml formatted file to specify a list of tasks to apply when creating a new dev box. These tasks can be as simple as installing a package, or as sophisticated as running a complex set of scripts to set up a code base. Tasks identify the catalog task and provide parameters like the name of the software to install. The customization file is then made available to the developers creating new dev boxes. 

The following example uses a winget task to install Visual Studio Code, and a git clone task to clone a repository.

```yml
# From https://github.com/microsoft/devcenter-examples
$schema: 1.0
tasks:
  - name: winget
    parameters:
      package: Microsoft.VisualStudioCode
      runAsUser: true
  - name: git-clone
    description: Clone this repository into C:\Workspaces
    parameters:
      repositoryUrl: https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore.git
      directory: C:\Workspaces
```

There are two ways to use a customization file: individual customizations which apply to a single dev box, and team customizations which apply to a whole team.

### Individual Customization files
- Contain tasks that are applied when a dev box is created.
- Uploaded by the developer when they create a dev box.

### Team Customization files
- Contain tasks that are applied when a dev box is created.
- Are shared across a team or project.
- Include a field that specifies the base image.
- Are named *imagedefinition.yaml*.
- Are uploaded to the repository that hosts your catalog.
- Are automatically used when you create a dev box from a configured pool. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Image definitions can only use Dev Box marketplace images as base images. To get a list of images that your DevCenter has access to, use this az cli command:
> ```bash
> az devcenter admin image list --dev-center-name CustomizationsImagingHQ --resource-group TeamCustomizationsImagingRG --query "[].name"
> ```

## Create a customization file

You can create and manage customization files with Visual Studio Code. You can use the [Microsoft Dev Box Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DevCenter.ms-devbox) to discover the tasks in the attached catalog, and test the customization file in Visual Studio Code.

1. Create a Dev Box (or use an existing Dev Box) for testing.
1. On the test dev box, install Visual Studio Code and then install the [Dev Box VS Code extension](https://aka.ms/devbox/preview/customizations/vsc-extension).
1. Download an [example yaml customization file](https://aka.ms/devbox/customizations/samplefile) from the samples repository and open it in Visual Studio Code.
1. Discover tasks available in the catalog by using the command palette. From **View** > **Command Palette**, select **Dev Box: List available tasks for this dev box**.

1. Test customization in Visual Studio Code by using f5/command palette. From **View** > **Command Palette**, select **Dev Box: Apply customizations tasks**.

1. The customization file runs immediately, applying the specified tasks to your test dev box. Inspect the changes and check the Visual Studio Code terminal for any errors or warnings generated during the task execution.

1. When the customization file runs successfully, upload it to your catalog.

## Clone a private repository using a customization file
You can use secrets from your Azure Key Vault in your yaml customizations to clone private repositories, or with any custom task you author that requires an access token. In a team customization file, you can use a personal access token (PAT) stored in a key vault to access a private repository. git 

### Use Key Vault secrets in team customization files
 To clone a private repository, store your PAT as an Azure KeyVault secret, and use it when invoking the git-clone task in your customization.

To configure your Key Vault secrets for use in your yaml customizations:
1. Ensure that your dev center project's managed identity has the Key Vault Reader role and Key Vault Secrets User role on your key vault.
2. Grant the Secrets User role for the Key Vault secret to each user or user group who should be able to consume the secret during the customization of a dev box. The user or group granted the role must include the managed identity for the dev center, your own user account, and any user or group who needs the secret during the customization of a dev box.

For more information, see:
- [Learn how to Configure a managed identity for a dev center](../deployment-environments/how-to-configure-managed-identity.md#configure-a-managed-identity-for-a-dev-center).
- [Learn how to Grant the managed identity access to the key vault secret](../deployment-environments/how-to-configure-managed-identity.md#grant-the-managed-identity-access-to-the-key-vault-secret).

You can reference the secret in your yaml customization in the following format, using the git-clone task as an example:

```yml
$schema: "1.0"
tasks:
   name: git-clone
   description: Clone this repository into C:\Workspaces
      parameters:
         repositoryUrl: https://myazdo.visualstudio.com/MyProject/_git/myrepo
         directory: C:\Workspaces
         pat: '{{KEY_VAULT_SECRET_URI}}'
```
### Use Key Vault secrets in individual customization files
If you wish to clone a private Azure Repos repository from an individual customization file, you don't need to configure a secret in Key Vault. Instead, you can use `{{ado}}`, or `{{ado://your-ado-organization-name}}` as a parameter. This fetches an access token on your behalf when creating a dev box, which has read-only permission to your repository. The git-clone task in the quickstart catalog uses the access token to clone your repository. Here's an example:

```yml
tasks:
   name: git-clone
   description: Clone this repository into C:\Workspaces
      parameters:
         repositoryUrl: https://myazdo.visualstudio.com/MyProject/_git/myrepo
         directory: C:\Workspaces
         pat: '{{ado://YOUR_ADO_ORG}}'
```

Your dev center needs access to your key vault. DevCenter does not support service tags, so if your key vault is kept private you must allow trusted Microsoft services to bypass the firewall.

To learn how to allow trusted Microsoft services to bypass the firewall, see [Configure Azure Key Vault networking settings](/azure/key-vault/general/how-to-azure-key-vault-network-security).

### Customize your dev box by using existing WinGet Configuration files
WinGet configuration takes a config-as-code approach to defining the unique sets of software and configuration settings needed to get your Windows environment in a ready-to-code state. These configuration files can also be used to set up a Dev Box, by using a WinGet task included in the Microsoft provided quickstart catalog mentioned earlier.
The following example shows a dev box customization file that calls an existing WinGet Desired State Configuration (DSC) file.

```yml
tasks:
    - name: winget
      parameters:
          configure: "projectConfiguration.dsc.yaml"
```

To learn more about WinGet Configuration, see [WinGet Configuration](https://aka.ms/winget-configuration).

## Share a customization file from a code repository
Make your customization file available to dev box pools by naming it *imagedefinition.yaml* and uploading it to the repository that hosts your catalog. When you create a dev box pool, you can select the customization file from the catalog to apply to the dev boxes in the pool.
