Use the following command to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it using the [az group delete](/azure-resource-manager/management/delete-resource-group?tabs=azure-cli#tabpanel_1_azure-cli) command - unless you have an ongoing need for these resources. Some of these resources may take a while to create, as well as to delete.
