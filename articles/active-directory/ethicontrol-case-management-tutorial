# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Ethicontrol Whistleblowing and Case Management (ECTRL)

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Ethicontrol Whistleblowing and Case Management (ECTRL) with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Ethicontrol Whistleblowing and Case Management (ECTRL) with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Ethicontrol Whistleblowing and Case Management (ECTRL).
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Ethicontrol Whistleblowing and Case Management (ECTRL) with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Ethicontrol Whistleblowing and Case Management (ECTRL) single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Ethicontrol Whistleblowing and Case Management (ECTRL) supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Ethicontrol Whistleblowing and Case Management (ECTRL) from the gallery

To configure the integration of Ethicontrol Whistleblowing and Case Management (ECTRL) into Azure AD, you need to add Ethicontrol Whistleblowing and Case Management (ECTRL) from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Ethicontrol Whistleblowing and Case Management (ECTRL)** in the search box.
1. Select **Ethicontrol Whistleblowing and Case Management (ECTRL)** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Ethicontrol Whistleblowing and Case Management (ECTRL)

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Ethicontrol Whistleblowing and Case Management (ECTRL) using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Ethicontrol Whistleblowing and Case Management (ECTRL).

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Ethicontrol Whistleblowing and Case Management (ECTRL), perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable J.Black to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Ethicontrol Whistleblowing and Case Management (ECTRL) SSO](#configure-ethicontrol-case-management-ectrl-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Ethicontrol Whistleblowing and Case Management (ECTRL) test user](#create-ethicontrol-case-management-ectrl-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of J.Black in Ethicontrol Whistleblowing and Case Management (ECTRL) that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Ethicontrol Whistleblowing and Case Management (ECTRL)** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
