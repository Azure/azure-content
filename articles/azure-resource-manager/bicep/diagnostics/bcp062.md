# Bicep error code - BCP062

This error occurs when the referenced declaration has an error.

## Error description

`The referenced declaration with name <type-name> is not valid.`

## Examples

The following example raises the error because the referenced [user-defined data type](../user-defined-data-types.md) has an error:

```bicep
type ball = object.bar

output tennisBall ball = {
  name: 'tennis'
  color: 'yellow'
}
```

You can fix the error by fixing the _ball_ definition:

```bicep
type ball = object

output tennisBall ball = {
  name: 'tennis'
  color: 'yellow'
}
```
