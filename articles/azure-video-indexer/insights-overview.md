# Azure Video Indexer insights

Insights contain an aggregated view of the data: faces, topics, emotions. Azure Video Indexer analyzes the video and audio content by running 30+ AI models, generating rich insights. For more information about available models, see [overview](video-indexer-overview.md).

[!INCLUDE [insights](./includes/insights.md)]

The [Azure Video Indexer](https://www.videoindexer.ai/) website enables you to use your video's deep insights to: find the right media content, locate the parts that youâ€™re interested in, and use the results to create an entirely new project. Once created, the project can be rendered and downloaded from Azure Video Indexer and be used in your own editing applications or downstream workflows. For more information, see [Use editor to create projects](use-editor-create-project.md).

Once you are [set up](video-indexer-get-started.md) with Azure Video Indexer, start using [insights](video-indexer-output-json-v2.md) and check out other **How to guides**.
