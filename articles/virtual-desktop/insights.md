# Use Azure Virtual Desktop Insights to monitor your deployment

Azure Virtual Desktop Insights is a dashboard built on Azure Monitor Workbooks that helps IT professionals understand their Azure Virtual Desktop environments. This topic will walk you through how to set up Azure Virtual Desktop Insights to monitor your Azure Virtual Desktop environments.

## Requirements

Before you start using Azure Virtual Desktop Insights, you'll need to set up the following things:

- All Azure Virtual Desktop environments you monitor must be based on the latest release of Azure Virtual Desktop thatâ€™s compatible with Azure Resource Manager.
- At least one configured Log Analytics Workspace. Use a designated Log Analytics workspace for your Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts to ensure that performance counters and events are only collected from session hosts in your Azure Virtual Desktop deployment.
- Enable data collection for the following things in your Log Analytics workspace:
    - Diagnostics from your Azure Virtual Desktop environment
    - Recommended performance counters from your Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts
    - Recommended Windows Event Logs from your Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts

 The data setup process described in this article is the only one you'll need to monitor Azure Virtual Desktop. You can disable all other items sending data to your Log Analytics workspace to save costs.

Anyone monitoring Azure Virtual Desktop Insights for your environment will also need the following read-access permissions:

- Read-access to the Azure resource groups that hold your Azure Virtual Desktop resources.
- Read-access to the subscription's resource groups that hold your Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts.
- Read access to the Log Analytics workspace. In the case that multiple Log Analytics workspaces are used, read access should be granted to each to allow viewing data.

> [!NOTE]
> Read access only lets admins view data. They'll need different permissions to manage resources in the Azure Virtual Desktop portal.

## Open Azure Virtual Desktop Insights

You can open Azure Virtual Desktop Insights with one of the following methods:

- Go to [aka.ms/avdi](https://aka.ms/avdi).
- Search for and select **Azure Virtual Desktop** from the Azure portal, then select **Insights**.
- Search for and select **Azure Monitor** from the Azure portal. Select **Insights Hub** under **Insights**, then select **Azure Virtual Desktop**.
Once you have the page open, enter the **Subscription**, **Resource group**, **Host pool**, and **Time range** of the environment you want to monitor.

## Log Analytics settings

To start using Azure Virtual Desktop Insights, you'll need at least one Log Analytics workspace. Use a designated Log Analytics workspace for your Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts to ensure that performance counters and events are only collected from session hosts in your Azure Virtual Desktop deployment. If you already have a workspace set up, skip ahead to [Set up using the configuration workbook](#set-up-using-the-configuration-workbook). To set one up, see [Create a Log Analytics workspace in the Azure portal](../azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace.md).

>[!NOTE]
>Standard data storage charges for Log Analytics will apply. To start, we recommend you choose the pay-as-you-go model and adjust as you scale your deployment and take in more data. To learn more, see [Azure Monitor pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/).

## Set up using the configuration workbook

If it's your first time opening Azure Virtual Desktop Insights, you'll need set up Azure Virtual Desktop Insights for your Azure Virtual Desktop environment. To configure your resources:

1. Open Azure Virtual Desktop Insights in the Azure portal at [aka.ms/avdi](https://aka.ms/avdi), then select **configuration workbook**.
2. Select an environment to configure under **Subscription**, **Resource Group**, and **Host Pool**.

The configuration workbook sets up your monitoring environment and lets you check the configuration after you've finished the setup process. It's important to check your configuration if items in the dashboard aren't displaying correctly, or when the product group publishes updates that require new settings.

### Resource diagnostic settings

To collect information on your Azure Virtual Desktop infrastructure, you'll need to enable several diagnostic settings on your Azure Virtual Desktop host pools and workspaces (this is your Azure Virtual Desktop workspace, not your Log Analytics workspace). To learn more about host pools, workspaces, and other Azure Virtual Desktop resource objects, see our [environment guide](environment-setup.md).

You can learn more about Azure Virtual Desktop diagnostics and the supported diagnostic tables at [Send Azure Virtual Desktop diagnostics to Log Analytics](diagnostics-log-analytics.md).

To set your resource diagnostic settings in the configuration workbook: 

1. Select the **Resource diagnostic settings** tab in the configuration workbook. 
2. Select **Log Analytics workspace** to send Azure Virtual Desktop diagnostics. 

#### Host pool diagnostic settings

To set up host pool diagnostics using the resource diagnostic settings section in the configuration workbook:

1. Under **Host pool**, check to see whether Azure Virtual Desktop diagnostics are enabled. If they aren't, an error message will appear that says "No existing diagnostic configuration was found for the selected host pool." You'll need to enable the following supported diagnostic tables:

    - Checkpoint
    - Error
    - Management
    - Connection
    - HostRegistration
    - AgentHealthStatus
    
    >[!NOTE]
    > If you don't see the error message, you don't need to do steps 2 through 4.

2. Select **Configure host pool**.
3. Select **Deploy**.
4. Refresh the configuration workbook.

#### Workspace diagnostic settings 

To set up workspace diagnostics using the resource diagnostic settings section in the configuration workbook:

 1. Under **Workspace**, check to see whether Azure Virtual Desktop diagnostics are enabled for the Azure Virtual Desktop workspace. If they aren't, an error message will appear that says "No existing diagnostic configuration was found for the selected workspace." You'll need to enable the following supported diagnostics tables:
 
    - Checkpoint
    - Error
    - Management
    - Feed
    
    >[!NOTE]
    > If you don't see the error message, you don't need to do steps 2-4.

2. Select **Configure workspace**.
3. Select **Deploy**.
4. Refresh the configuration workbook.

### Session host data settings

To collect information on your Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts, you'll need to configure a Data Collection Rule (DCR) to collect performance data and Windows Event Logs, associated the session hosts with the DCR, install the Azure Monitor Agent on all session hosts in host pools from which you would like to collect data, and ensure the session hosts are sending data to a Log Analytics workspace.

The Log Analytics workspace you send session host data to doesn't have to be the same one you send diagnostic data to. If you have Azure session hosts outside of your Azure Virtual Desktop environment, we recommend having a designated Log Analytics workspace for the Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts.

To configure a DCR and select a Log Analytics workspace destination using the configuration workbook:

1.	Select the Session host data settings tab in the configuration workbook.
2.	Select the Log Analytics workspace you want to send session host data to.
3.	If a Data Collection Rule (DCR) has not already been configured, select Create data collection rule to have the configuration workbook automatically configure the DCR.

#### Session hosts

You'll need to install the Azure Monitor Agent on all session hosts in the host pool and send data from those hosts to your selected Log Analytics workspace. If the Azure Monitor Agent isn't configured for all the session hosts in the host pool, you'll see a Session hosts section at the top of Session host data settings with the message "Some hosts in the host pool are not sending data to the selected Log Analytics workspace."

>[!NOTE]
> If you don't see the **Session hosts** section or error message, all session hosts are set up correctly. Currently automated deployment is limited to 1000 session hosts or fewer.

To set up your remaining session hosts using the configuration workbook:

1.	Select the DCR to be used for data collection
2.	To create the DCR association select Deploy association.
3.	To deploy the Azure Monitor Agent select Add extension.
4.	To configure the required [managed identity](../azure-monitor/agents/azure-monitor-agent-manage?#prerequisites) select Add system managed identity

>[!NOTE]
>For larger host pools (> 1000 session hosts), or if there are deployment issues, it is recommended to [install the Azure Monitor Agent](../azure-monitor/agents/azure-monitor-agent-manage?#install) at time of session host creation through the use of an ARM template.

## Optional: configure alerts

Azure Virtual Desktop Insights allows you to monitor Azure Monitor alerts happening within your selected subscription in the context of your Azure Virtual Desktop data. Azure Monitor alerts are an optional feature on your Azure subscriptions, and you need to set them up separately from Azure Virtual Desktop Insights. You can use the Azure Monitor alerts framework to set custom alerts on Azure Virtual Desktop events, diagnostics, and resources. To learn more about Azure Monitor alerts, see [Azure Monitor Log Alerts](../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-log.md).

## Diagnostic and usage data

Microsoft automatically collects usage and performance data through your use of the Azure Virtual Desktop Insights service. Microsoft uses this data to improve the quality, security, and integrity of the service.

To provide accurate and efficient troubleshooting capabilities, the collected data includes the portal session ID, Azure Active Directory user ID, and the name of the portal tab where the event occurred. Microsoft doesn't collect names, addresses, or other contact information.

For more information about data collection and usage, see the [Microsoft Online Services Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).

>[!NOTE]
>To learn about viewing or deleting your personal data collected by the service, see [Azure Data Subject Requests for the GDPR](/microsoft-365/compliance/gdpr-dsr-azure).
