# Document Intelligence pay stub model

The Document Intelligence pay stub model combines powerful Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities with deep learning models to analyze and extract compensation and earnings data from pay slips. The API analyzes documents and files with payroll related information; extracts key information and returns a structured JSON data representation.

Pay stubs are essential documents issued by employers to employees, providing earnings, deductions, and net pay information for a specific pay period. See how data is extracted using `prebuilt-payStub.us` model. You need the following resources:

* An Azure subscriptionâ€”you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/)
