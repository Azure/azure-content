# **Quickstart: Create confidential VM in the Azure portal**

1. **Create a new Virtual Machine**  
   a. Visit [portal.azure.com/\#create/Microsoft.VirtualMachine](https://portal.azure.com/\#create/Microsoft.VirtualMachine). If not signed in, you'll be prompted to log in to your Azure account.

      Note: Alternatively, you can go to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com), locate "Virtual machines" in the left sidebar (If the sidebar is hidden, click the hamburger menu â˜° in the top-left corner to reveal it)

   b. On the **Virtual machines** page, click **Create** and choose **Azure virtual machine** from the dropdown menu.  
<br>

2. **Configure VM settings \- Basics**  
   The following settings represent the minimum required setup. Additional options are available to tailor the VM to your specific requirements.

3. **Configure VM settings \- Disks**  
   Once the **Basics** settings are complete, select the **Disks** tab to continue configuration of your new confidential VM.

      <tr>
        <td colspan="2" rowspan="1">
          <p><strong>VM disk encryption</strong></p>

      <tr>
        <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
          <p>Key Management</p>
        </td>
        <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
          <p>Select the type of key to use</p>
          <p></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Confidential disk encryption with a <strong>Platform-managed key</strong> is selected by default, which ensures keys are generated, stored and managed by Azure</li>
            <li>Select Confidential disk encryption with <strong>Customer-managed key</strong> if you prefer your keys are generated, stored and managed by you in your Azure Key Vault or Managed HSM. 
- If you choose to select customer managed key option, you should create a <strong> confidential disk encryption set </strong> before. You can create a Confidential disk encryption set, by creating an Azure Key Vault using the Premium pricing tier that includes support for HSM backed keys (While creating, it's important to enable purge protection for added security measures, for the access configuration, use the "Vault access policy" under "Access confidguration" tab) or alternatively, you can create an Azure Key Vault managed Hardware Security Module.
- In the Azure portal, search for and select Disk Encryption Sets.
- Select Create.
- For Subscription, select which Azure subscription to use.
- For Resource group, select or create a new resource group to use.
- For Disk encryption set name, enter a name for the set.
- For Region, select an available Azure region.
- For Encryption type, select Confidential disk encryption with a customer-managed key.
- For Key Vault, select the key vault you already created.
- Under Key Vault, select Create new to create a new key.
- If you selected an Azure managed HSM previously, use PowerShell or the Azure CLI to create the new key instead.
- For Name, enter a name for the key.
- For the key type, select RSA-HSM
- Select your key size
- Under Confidential Key Options select Exportable and set the Confidential operation policy as CVM confidential operation policy.
- Select Create to finish creating the key.
- Select Review + create to create new disk encryption set. Wait for the resource creation to complete successfully.
- Go to the disk encryption set resource in the Azure portal.
- When you see a blue info banner, please follow the instructions provided to grant access. On encountering a pink banner, simply select it to grant the necessary permissions to Azure Key Vault.

Important: You must perform this step to successfully create the confidential VM.

4. **Finish setup**  
* If needed, continue making additional changes to settings under the tabs **Networking**, **Management**, **Monitoring**, **Advanced** and **Tags**.  
* Select **Review \+ create** to validate your configuration.  
* Wait for validation to complete. If necessary, fix any validation issues, then select **Review \+ create** again.

<br>

5. **Connect to your new confidential VM**  
* To connect to a confidential VM with a Windows OS, see [How to connect and sign on to an Azure virtual machine running Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/connect-logon).
* For more information about connecting to Linux VMs, see [Quickstart: Create a Linux virtual machine in the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal).

<br>

6. **Cleanup**  
* Visit [https://portal.azure.com/\#browse/resourcegroups](https://portal.azure.com/\#browse/resourcegroups) to see all the resource groups you have created. You will be asked to log in if you havenâ€™t done so already.  
* Select the resource group you created for this quickstart guide.  
* On the resource group's menu, select **Delete resource group**.  
* In the warning pane, enter the resource group's name to confirm the deletion.  
* Select **Delete** to delete all the resources created under the resource group.

## **FAQ**

1. **Can I convert a non-confidential VM into a confidential VM?**\
No. For security reasons, you must create a confidential VM as such from the start.

2. **Do I have to use the full-disk encryption scheme? Can I use a standard scheme instead?**\
The optional full-disk encryption scheme is Azure's most secure and meets the [Confidential Computing principles](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/azure-confidential-computing/). However, you can also use other [disk encryption schemes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disk-encryption-overview) along with or instead of full-disk encryption. If you use multiple disk encryption schemes, double encryption might negatively affect performance.

3. **Can I enable Azure Accelerated Networking on confidential VMs?**\
No. Confidential VMs don't support Accelerated Networking. You can't enable Accelerated Networking for any confidential VM deployment, or any Azure Kubernetes Service cluster deployment that runs on Confidential Computing.
