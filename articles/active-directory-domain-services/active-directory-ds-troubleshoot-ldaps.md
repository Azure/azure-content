# Azure AD Domain Services - Troubleshooting Secure LDAP Configuration


**some type of introduction sentence**

## Creating the right Network Security Group
To ensure that Microsoft can service and maintain you managed domain, you must use a Network Security Group (NSG) to allow access to specific ports inside your subnet. If these ports are blocked, Microsoft cannot access the resources it needs, which may be detrimental to your service. While creating your NSG, keep these ports open to ensure no interruption in service.

| Port number | Purpose|
|:----------|:------------|
| 443 | Synchronization with your Azure AD tenant |
| 3389 | Management of your domain |
| 5986 | Management of your domain |
| 636 | Secure LDAP (LDAPS) access to your managed domain |

In addition, when secure LDAP is enabled, we recommend creating additional rules to allow inbound LDAPS access only from certain IP addresses. This protects your domain from brute force attacks that could pose a security threat. 

Lastly, we suggest creating a rule with the lowest priority to deny any other access. This secures your domain and applies to all other inbound traffic from the internet.


### Sample NSG
Below is a table that depicts a sample NSG that would keep your managed domain secure while allowing Microsoft to monitor, manage, and update information.
