# Azure Key Vault Storage Account Keys
Azure Key Vault Storage Account Keys
=====================================
Before Azure Key Vault Storage Account Keys, developers had to manage their own Azure Storage Account (ASA)keys and rotate them manually or through an external automation. Now, Key Vault Storage Account Keys are implemented as Key Vault secrets for authenticating with an Azure Storage Account. In other words in Azure Key Vault supports a new type called Storage Account Keys.
This relieves developers from rotating the storage account keys manually

What Key Vault manages
----------------------
Key Vault performs several internal management functions on your behalf when you use Managed Storage Account Keys.

- Azure Key Vault manages keys of an Azure Storage Account (ASA).
    - Internally, Azure Key Vault can list (sync) keys with an Azure Storage Account.    
    - Azure Key Vault regenerates (rotates) the keys periodically.
    - Key values are never returned in response to caller.
    - Azure Key Vault manages keys of both Storage Accounts and Classic Storage Accounts.

Prerequisites
--------------
1. [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
   Install Azure CLI   
2. [Create a Storage Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/)
    - Please follow the steps in this [document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/) to create a storage account  
    - **Naming guidance:**
      Storage account names must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and may contain numbers and lowercase letters only.        
      
Step by step instructions
-------------------------

1. Get the resource ID of the Azure Storage Account you want to manage.
    a. Once we create a storage account 
    ```
    az storage account show -n storageaccountname (Copy ID out of the result of this command)
    ```
2. Get the resource ID of the Azure Storage Account you want to manage.
    ```
    az storage account show -n storageaccountname (Take ID out of this)
    ```
3. Get Application ID of Azure Key Vault's service principal 
    ```
    az ad sp show --id cfa8b339-82a2-471a-a3c9-0fc0be7a4093
    ```
4. Assign Storage Key Operator role to Azure Key Vault Identity
    ```
    az role assignment create --role "Storage Account Key Operator Service Role"  --assignee-object-id hhjkh --scope idofthestorageaccount
    ```
5. Create a Key Vault Managed Storage Account.     <br /><br />
   Below command asks Key Vault to regenerate the key every 90 days.
   Below command asks Key Vault to regenerate your storage's access keys periodically, with a regeneration period. Below, we are setting a regeneration period of 30 days. After 30 days, Key Vault will regenerate 'key1' and swap the active key from 'key2' to 'key1'.
    ```
    az keyvault storage add --vault-name PrashanthOfficial -n <StorageAccountName> --active-key-name key2 --auto-generate-key --regeneration-period P30D --resource-id <Resource-id-of-storage-account>
    ```
    In case the user didn't create the storage account and does not have permissions to the storage account, the steps below set the permissions for your account to ensure that you can manage all the storage permissions in the Key Vault.
    [!NOTE] In the case that the user does not permissions to the storage account 
    We first get the object id of the user

    ```
    az ad user show --upn-or-object-id "developer@contoso.com"

    az keyvault set-policy --name PrashanthOfficial --object-id 4dkjhkjhkj --storage-permissions backup delete list regeneratekey recover purge restore set setsas update
    ```
