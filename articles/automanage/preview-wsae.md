# Previewing Windows Server VNext Datacenter: Azure Edition

## About Windows Server VNext Datacenter: Azure Edition previews

[Windows Server: Azure Edition (WSAE)](https://aka.ms/wsae) is a new edition of Windows Server focused on innovation and efficiency. Featuring an annual release cadence and optimized to run on Azure properties, WSAE brings new functionality to Windows Server users faster than the traditional Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) editions of Windows Server (2016,2019,2022, etc.) the first version of this new variant is Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition, announced at Microsoft Ignite in November 2021.
The annual WSAE releases are delivered using Windows Update, rather than a full OS upgrade. As part of this annual release cadence, the WSAE Insider preview program will spin up each spring with the opportunity to access early builds of the next release - leading to general availability in the fall. 
If you are a registered Microsoft Server Insider, you have access to create and use virtual machine images from this preview. For more information and to manage your Insider membership, visit the [Windows Insider home page](https://insider.windows.com/) or [Windows Insiders for Business home page.](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/for-business/)

## Whatâ€™s in the preview?

Much like the [Dev Channel of the insider program for Windows 11](https://insider.windows.com/understand-flighting), the WSAE Preview comes *directly from an active, still-in-development codebase.* As a result, you may encounter some features that are not yet complete, and in some cases, you may see features & functionality that **will not** appear in the Azure Edition annual release.
Details regarding each preview will be shared in release announcements posted to the [Windows Server Insiders](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-server-insiders/bd-p/WindowsServerInsiders) space on Microsoft Tech Community.
