#Customer intent: As a new developer, I want to make my first call to the Bing Web Search API and receive a response using Node.js.

# Quickstart: Use Node.js to call the Bing Web Search API

Use this quickstart to make your first call to the Bing Web Search API and receive a JSON response in less than 10 minutes.

[!INCLUDE [bing-web-search-quickstart-signup](../../../../includes/bing-web-search-quickstart-signup.md)]

## Prerequisites

Here are a few things that you'll need before running this quickstart:

* [Node.js 6](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or later
* A subscription key

## Create a project and declare required modules

Create a new Node.js project in your favorite IDE or editor.
Then copy the code snippet below into your project in a file named `search.js`.
First we require `https` from the standard library, we'll use it to send and receive data.

```javascript
// Usage:
//
//   node search.js "My awesome query"
//
const https = require('https')
```

## Set the subscription key

This code looks up the environment variable, `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY`,
which you can find on
[your apis page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/?apiSlug=search-api-v7).

```javascript
// HOWTO: set an environment variable https://is.gd/zu55jA
const SUBSCRIPTION_KEY = process.env['AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY']
if (!SUBSCRIPTION_KEY) {
  throw new Error('Missing the AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY environment varable')
}
```



## Create a function to make the request

This function will make a secure GET request, saving the search query as a query parameter in the path.
We use `encodeURIComponent` to escape any invalid characters, and we pass our subscription key in a header.
The callback receives a
[response](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse),
subscribing to the `data` event in order to aggregate the JSON body,
the `error` event to log any issues,
and the `end` event so it knows when it has the full body.
At that time, it will print the interesting headers and the body.
You can play with the colors and set the depth to suit your preference,
a depth of `1` gives a nice summary of the response.


```javascript
function bingWebSearch(query) {
  https.get({
    hostname: 'api.cognitive.microsoft.com',
    path:     '/bing/v7.0/search?q=' + encodeURIComponent(query),
    headers:  { 'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': SUBSCRIPTION_KEY },
  }, res => {
    let body = ''
    res.on('data', part => body += part)
    res.on('end', () => {
      for (var header in res.headers) {
        if (header.startsWith("bingapis-") || header.startsWith("x-msedge-")) {
          console.log(header + ": " + res.headers[header])
        }
      }
      console.log('\nJSON Response:\n')
      console.dir(JSON.parse(body), { colors: false, depth: null })
    })
    res.on('error', e => {
      console.log('Error: ' + e.message)
      throw e
    })
  })
}
```

## Get the query

Here, we'll look at the program's arguments to find the query.
It's in the second argument because the first is the path to node,
the second is our filename, and the third is the first argument supplied by the user.
If the user doesn't supply an argument, we'll use a default query.

```javascript
const query = process.argv[2] || 'Microsoft Cognitive Services'
```

## Make a request and print the response

And now that everything is defined, we'll call our function!

```javascript
bingWebSearch(query)
```

## Put it all together

The last step is to run your code!  If you'd like to compare your code with ours, here's the complete program:

```javascript
// Usage:
//
//   node search.js "My awesome query"
//
const https = require('https')

// HOWTO: set an environment variable https://is.gd/zu55jA
const SUBSCRIPTION_KEY = process.env['AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY']
if (!SUBSCRIPTION_KEY) {
  throw new Error('Missing the AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY environment varable')
}

function bingWebSearch(query) {
  https.get({
    hostname: 'api.cognitive.microsoft.com',
    path:     '/bing/v7.0/search?q=' + encodeURIComponent(query),
    headers:  { 'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': SUBSCRIPTION_KEY },
  }, res => {
    let body = ''
    res.on('data', part => body += part)
    res.on('end', () => {
      for (var header in res.headers) {
        if (header.startsWith("bingapis-") || header.startsWith("x-msedge-")) {
          console.log(header + ": " + res.headers[header])
        }
      }
      console.log('\nJSON Response:\n')
      console.dir(JSON.parse(body), { colors: false, depth: null })
    })
    res.on('error', e => {
      console.log('Error: ' + e.message)
      throw e
    })
  })
}

const query = process.argv[2] || 'Microsoft Cognitive Services'
bingWebSearch(query)
```

## Sample response

Responses from the Bing Web Search API are returned as JSON. This sample response has been truncated to show a single result.
