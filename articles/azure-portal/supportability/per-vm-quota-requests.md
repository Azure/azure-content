# Standard quota: Increase limits by VM series

Azure Resource Manager supports two types of vCPU quotas for virtual machines:

* standard vCPU quota
* spot vCPU quota

## Standard vCPU quota

Standard vCPU quota applies to pay-as-you-go VMs and reserved VM instances and it is enforced at two tiers for each subscription in each region:

* The first tier is the *total regional vCPUs limit* and is enforced across all VM series.
* The second tier is the *per-VM series vCPUs limit* and is enforced for a given VM series such as the Dv3-series vCPUs.

An increase in the VM series quota automatically increases the total regional vCPU limit by the same amount. You can request an increase in the vCPU quota limit for a VM series using either [**Help + support**](#hs) or [**Subscriptions**](#subs) in the Azure portal.

## Spot vCPU quotas

Spot vCPU quotas apply to spot VMs. When you deploy a new spot VM, the total new and existing vCPU usage for all spot VM instances must not exceed the approved spot vCPU quota limit. If the spot quota is exceeded, the spot VM cannot be deployed.

## Learn more about standard and spot vCPU quotas

* To learn more about standard vCPU quotas, see [Check vCPU quotas using Azure PowerShell](../../virtual-machines/windows/quotas.md) and [Classic deployment model](./classic-deployment-model-quota-increase-requests.md).

* To learn about increasing the vCPU limit by region for standard quota, see [Standard quota: Increase limits by region](regional-quota-requests.md).

* To learn more about increasing spot VM vCPU limits, see [Spot quota: Increase limits for all VM series](low-priority-quota.md).

## Request a standard quota increase from Help + support<a name="hs"></a>

To request a standard vCPU quota increase per VM series from **Help + support**:

> [!NOTE]
> You can also request a quota limit increase for multiple regions through a single support case. For details, see step 8.

1. On  the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) menu, select **Help + support**.

4. For **Subscription**, select the subscription whose quota you want to increase.

   ![Select a subscription for an increased quota](./media/resource-manager-core-quotas-request/select-subscription-support-request.png)

5. For **Quota type**, select **Compute-VM (cores-vCPUs) subscription limit increases**.

   ![Select a quota type](./media/resource-manager-core-quotas-request/select-quota-type.png)

6. Select **Next: Solutions** to open **PROBLEM DETAILS**. Select **Provide details** to enter additional information.

   ![TProvide additional quota details](./media/resource-manager-core-quotas-request/quota-details-deployment-rm-locations.png)

   a.  For **Deployment model**, select the appropriate model.
  
   b.  For **Locations**, select a location. For the selected location, select the quota types you want to modify. You can request both standard and spot quota types from a single support case through multi-selection support.

   For more information about increasing spot quota limits, see [Azure spot VMs for virtual machine scale sets](../../virtual-machine-scale-sets/use-spot.md).
  
   c.  In **Standard**, select the SKU series for increased quotas.
  
  ![Quota details - SKU series](./media/resource-manager-core-quotas-request/quota-details-standard-select-series.png)
  
   d.  Enter the new quota limits that you want for this subscription. To remove a SKU from your list, clear the check box next to the SKU or select the discard "X" icon.

9. Select **Save and continue** to continue creating the support request.

## Request a standard quota increase from Subscriptions<a name="subs"></a>

To request a standard vCPU quota increase per VM series from **Subscriptions**:

> [!NOTE]
> You can also request a quota limit increase for multiple regions through a single support case. For details, see step 7.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for and select **Subscriptions**.

   ![Subscriptions in the Azure portal search](./media/resource-manager-core-quotas-request/search-for-subscriptions.png)

1. Select the subscription whose quota you want to increase.

1. At the top right, select **Request increase**.

   ![Select to increase quota](./media/resource-manager-core-quotas-request/request-increase-from-subscription.png)

1. For **Quota type**, select **Compute-VM (cores-vCPUs) subscription limit increases**.

   ![Select a quota type](./media/resource-manager-core-quotas-request/select-quota-type.png)

1. In the **Quota details**, do the following steps:

   1. For **Deployment model**, select the appropriate model. For **Locations**, select a location.

      ![Provide quota details](./media/resource-manager-core-quotas-request/quota-details-deployment-rm-locations.png)

   1. For the selected location, under **Types**, select **Select a type**, and then select **Standard**.

      ![Select Standard type](./media/resource-manager-core-quotas-request/quota-details-select-standard-type.png)

      Under **Types**, you can request both standard and spot quota types from a single support case through multi-selection support.

      For more information about increasing spot quota limits, see [Azure spot VMs for virtual machine scale sets](../../virtual-machine-scale-sets/use-spot.md).

   1. For **Standard**, select the SKU series whose quotas you want to increase.

      ![Quota details - SKU series](./media/resource-manager-core-quotas-request/quota-details-standard-select-series.png)
