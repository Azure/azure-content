# Self-help for serverless SQL pool

This article contains information about how to troubleshoot most frequent problems with serverless SQL pool in Azure Synapse Analytics.

## Serverless SQL pool is grayed out in Synapse Studio

If Synapse Studio can't establish connection to serverless SQL pool, you'll notice that serverless SQL pool is grayed out or shows status "Offline". Usually, this problem occurs when one of the following cases happens:

1) Your network prevents communication to Azure Synapse backend. Most frequent case is that port 1443 is blocked. To get the serverless SQL pool to work, unblock this port. Other problems could prevent serverless SQL pool to work as well, [visit full troubleshooting guide for more information](../troubleshoot/troubleshoot-synapse-studio.md).
2) You don't have permissions to log into serverless SQL pool. To gain access, one of the Azure Synapse workspace administrators should add you to workspace administrator or SQL administrator role. [Visit full guide on access control for more information](../security/synapse-workspace-access-control-overview.md).

## Query fails because file cannot be opened

If your query fails with the error saying 'File cannot be opened because it does not exist or it is used by another process' and you're sure both file exist and it's not used by another process it means serverless SQL pool can't access the file. This problem usually happens because your Azure Active Directory identity doesn't have rights to access the file. By default, serverless SQL pool is trying to access the file using your Azure Active Directory identity. To resolve this issue, you need to have proper rights to access the file. Easiest way is to grant yourself 'Storage Blob Data Contributor' role on the storage account you're trying to query.

- [Visit Control storage account access for serverless SQL pool in Azure Synapse Analytics](develop-storage-files-storage-access-control.md)

## Query fails because it cannot be executed due to current resource constraints 

If your query fails with the error message 'This query can't be executed due to current resource constraints', it means that serverless SQL pool isn't able to execute it at this moment due to resource constraints: 

- Make sure data types of reasonable sizes are used. Also, specify schema for Parquet files for string columns as they'll be VARCHAR(8000) by default. 

- If your query targets CSV files, consider [creating statistics](develop-tables-statistics.md#statistics-in-serverless-sql-pool). 

- Visit [performance best practices for serverless SQL pool](best-practices-sql-on-demand.md) to optimize query.  

## CREATE 'STATEMENT' is not supported in master database

If your query fails with the error message:

> 'Failed to execute query. Error: CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE/DATA SOURCE/DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL/FILE FORMAT is not supported in master database.' 

it means that master database in serverless SQL pool does not support creation of:
  - External tables
  - External data sources
  - Database scoped credentials
  - External file formats

Solution:

  1. Create a user database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE <DATABASE_NAME>
```

  2. Execute create statement in the context of <DATABASE_NAME>, which failed earlier for master database. 
  
  Example for creation of External file format:
    
```sql
USE <DATABASE_NAME>
CREATE EXTERNAL FILE FORMAT [SynapseParquetFormat] 
WITH ( FORMAT_TYPE = PARQUET)
```

## Query fails with error while handling an external file. 

If your query fails with the error message “error handling external file: Max errors count reached’, it means that there is a mismatch of a specified column type and the data that needs to be loaded. 
To get more information about the error and which rows and columns to look at, change the parser version from ‘2.0’ to ‘1.0’. 

### Example
If you would like to query the file ‘names.csv’ with this query 1, Synapse SQL Serverless will return with this error. 

names.csv
```csv
Id, First name, 
1,Adam
2,Bob
3,Charles
4,David
5,Eva
```

Query 1
```sql
SELECT
    TOP 100 *
FROM
    OPENROWSET(
        BULK '[FILE-PATH OF CSV FILE]',
        FORMAT = 'CSV',
        PARSER_VERSION='2.0',
       FIELDTERMINATOR =';',
       FIRSTROW = 2
    ) 
    WITH (
    [ID] SMALLINT, 
    [Text] VARCHAR (1) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2 
)

    AS [result]
```
causes:
```Error handling external file: ‘Max error count reached’. File/External table name: [filepath].```

As soon as parser version is changed from version 2.0 to version 1.0, the error messages help to identify the problem. The new error message is now instead: 

```Bulk load data conversion error (truncation) for row 1, column 2 (Text) in data file [filepath]```

Truncation tells us that our column type is too small to fit our data. The longest first name in this ‘names.csv’ file has 7 characters. Therefore, the according data type to be used should be at least VARCHAR(7). 
The error is caused by this line of code: 

```sql 
    [Text] VARCHAR (1) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2
```
Changing the query accordingly resolves the error: After debugging, change the parser version to 2.0 again to achieve maximum performance. Read more about when to use which parser version [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/develop-openrowset) 

```sql 
SELECT
    TOP 100 *
FROM
    OPENROWSET(
        BULK '[FILE-PATH OF CSV FILE]',
        FORMAT = 'CSV',
        PARSER_VERSION='2.0',
        FIELDTERMINATOR =';',
        FIRSTROW = 2
    ) 
    WITH (
    [ID] SMALLINT, 
    [Text] VARCHAR (7) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2 
)

    AS [result]
```
