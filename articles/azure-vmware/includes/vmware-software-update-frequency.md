Updates also include drivers, software on the network switches, and firmware on the bare-metal nodes.

You'll be notified before and after patches are applied to your private clouds. We'll also work with you to schedule a maintenance window before applying updates or upgrades to your private cloud. 

Software updates include:

- **Patches** - Security patches or bug fixes released by VMware
- **Updates** - Minor version change of a VMware stack component
- **Upgrades** - Major version change of a VMware stack component

>[!NOTE]
>Microsoft tests a critical security patch as soon as it becomes available from VMware.

Documented VMware workarounds are implemented in lieu of installing a corresponding patch until the next scheduled updates are deployed.
